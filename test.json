It is time to create an account, clone the repo and smash some code! Not that easy ‚Äî this is what I got when I tried to add my public SSH key to newly created account.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone has already added that SSH key.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That‚Äôs right, I had this key already added under my personal account. Luckily the solution is simple and it applies the same, not only to Bitbucket, but also to other popular version control hosting services like <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://gitlab.com\">GitLab</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2020-08-10-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"&amp;ldquo;Key is already in use&amp;rdquo; alert on GitHub\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"934\"\n/>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#generate-multiple-ssh-keys\">Generate multiple SSH keys</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#add-new-keys-to-ssh-agent\">Add new keys to SSH agent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#add-public-keys-to-individual-bitbucket-accounts\">Add public keys to individual Bitbucket accounts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#configure-ssh\">Configure SSH</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#change-the-upstream-url-of-already-existing-repository\">Change the upstream URL of already existing repository</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"generate-multiple-ssh-keys\">Generate multiple SSH keys <a href=\"#generate-multiple-ssh-keys\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If we can‚Äôt use the same SSH key across multiple accounts (what makes perfect sense) the solution is to have multiple.

For example:</p>\n<pre><code>git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket-client.org:client/project.git\n</code></pre><p>This solution solved my problem and served me well.

It is a sequential way of handling chunks of bytes. Instead of loading a large amount of data to the memory all at once, streams are much more memory and time-efficient as they allow us to process an individual chunk as soon as it arrives. Streams are very useful (and sometimes the only way) to work with large amounts of data.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2020-07-14-1.png\"\n  alt=\"Node.js streams\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"600\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Apart from the implementation in Node.js, the concept of streams is present in many other programming languages like C++, Java and .NET. It‚Äôs used for things like reading from and writing to a file, network communications and any other information exchange.</p>\n<p>You can achieve a lot without using streams at all, but a thorough understanding of them will make you a much better developer. Often you will use them without even knowing that your favourite package heavily relies on them under the hood.

If not, look!</p>\n<pre><code>ls | grep .json \n</code></pre><p>This example lists files in a current directory (<code>ls</code>), and pipes the results to <code>grep</code> program that returns filtered by search pattern (<code>.json</code>) results.</p>\n<p>This example shows the greatest power of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">Unix philosophy</a> ‚Äî <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability\">code composability</a>.

Example!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">streamOne</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">pipe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">streamTwo</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">pipe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">streamThree</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"types-of-streams\">Types of streams <a href=\"#types-of-streams\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In Node.js the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\">built-in <code>stream</code> module</a> is useful for creating new types of stream instances, although it‚Äôs usually not necessary to use it because a lot of higher-level modules inherit from it. There are four types of streams and we are going to explore all of them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#readable-input-stream\">Readable</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#writable-output-stream\">Writable</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#duplex\">Duplex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#transform\">Transform</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"readable-input-stream\">Readable (input stream) <a href=\"#readable-input-stream\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A readable stream produces data. It can be consumed directly but most often it is fed into other types of streams (writable, transform, or duplex). They are also known as input streams. Commonly used readable streams in Node.js are HTTP server <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request\"><code>request</code></a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream\"><code>fs.ReadStream</code></a> returned by calling <code>fs.createReadStream()</code> or <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdin\"><code>process.stdin</code></a> just to name a few. Let&rsquo;s create a basic form of a stream and fill it with some data to be consumed later on.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kr\">import</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">Readable</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"nx\">from</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;stream&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// create a readable stream\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">Readable</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// push some data to the stream\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;some data 1&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;some data 2&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kc\">null</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Confusingly, we explicitly pushed a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_push_chunk_encoding\"><code>null</code> to the stream that signals the end of the stream (EOF)</a>, after which no more data can be written. It can also be achieved by implementing a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_read_size_1\"><code>_read</code></a> function. This is quite an advanced and detailed, definitely out of the scope of this tutorial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writable-output-stream\">Writable (output stream) <a href=\"#writable-output-stream\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A Writable stream allows us to consume data. They are also known as output streams. Commonly used writable streams in Node.js are HTTP server <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse\"><code>response</code></a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream\"><code>fs.WriteStream</code></a> returned by calling <code>fs.createWriteStream()</code>, <code>process.stdout</code> and <code>process.stderr</code> just to name a few. Time to consume the input from the previously created readable stream.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kr\">import</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">Readable</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">Writable</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"nx\">from</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;stream&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// create a stream\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">Readable</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// push some data to the stream\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;some data 1&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;some data 2&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kc\">null</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// create a writable stream\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">writableStream</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">Writable</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">writableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">_write</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">chunk</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">encoding</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">next</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">chunk</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">toString</span><span class=\"p\">())</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">next</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// connect readable and writable streams\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">pipe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">writableStream</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Like in readable stream we have to indicate the end of the stream using <code>null</code> value or <code>_read</code> function, in writable stream <code>_write</code> implementations must be provided to send data to the underlying resource. Again ‚Äî it‚Äôs not something that you are going to do a lot as it‚Äôs normally the lower-level implementation that you rarely have to care about. Here it‚Äôs just for example completeness. Can you see how readable stream has been piped to the writable stream using the previously discussed <code>pipe()</code> method? So, so, so nice!</p>\n<h3 id=\"duplex\">Duplex <a href=\"#duplex\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Duplex streams are implementing everything that we learned so far ‚Äî readable and writable stream functionalities. Whenever you come across something that looks like an example below, most likely you deal with the duplex type of a stream.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">readableStream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">pipe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">duplexStream</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">pipe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">writableStream</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"transform\">Transform <a href=\"#transform\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Similarly to duplex streams, transform streams are readable and writable streams at the same time. Based on the input, they transform the output. You may come across &ldquo;through streams&rdquo; name that describes the same thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a href=\"#conclusion\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I hope that after reading this article and seeing ‚Äúthis API inherits from stream module‚Äù won‚Äôt scare you away. I promise you that embracing the power of streams in Node.js will up your skills  to the next level.</p>\n<p>By the way, I spent a few hours writing this article and about a day on the image on the ‚ÄúWhat is a stream‚Äù section, so you better appreciate it and share it on Twitter or whatever that makes your friends read.

Let&rsquo;s have a look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object\">Wikipedia definition of Mock object</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways, most often as part of a software testing initiative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is plenty of JavaScript mocking libraries out there.

Yes ‚Äî but this is out of scope of a unit test. Unit test should be isolated, narrow in scope and quick to execute.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Af4M8GMoxi4\">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mock me&rdquo; by Justin Searls on YouTube</a> is a fantastic talk about things that should be mocked and where mocking should be avoided. <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/enterprise-architecture/mock-shortcomings.html\">&ldquo;Mock Objects: Shortcomings and Use Cases&rdquo; by Alex Ruiz</a> is another resource that I found very helpful.

Time after time I have heard about the book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup\">&ldquo;The Lean Startup&rdquo; by Eric Reis</a>, so I decided to finally give it a go.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2020-04-09-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Picture of &amp;ldquo;The Lean Startup&amp;rdquo; by Eric Ries book\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"934\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Lean Startup&rdquo; is an easy to read/listen-to publication.

From the concept of MVP (Minimal Viable Product), through to the quick iteration cycle, A/B testing, &ldquo;Five Whys Rule&rdquo; to very high-level considerations about the role of a startup in the market. Although it&rsquo;s written by an entrepreneur with a software development background, the insights from this book are super useful regardless of the industry. I highly recommend this book to not only to people interested in running a new startup but also to everyone who is involved in the process of building a quality product.</p>"},{"title":"What's new in ECMAScript 2020","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2020/","pubDate":"Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2020/","description":"<p>The list of new ECMAScript 2020 features is set in stone.

It was a cloudy February afternoon when I picked up a phone call from my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsbnunes\">Tiago Nunes</a>. Simple question‚Ä¶</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi dude. Would you like to host an international conference in Portugal?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My answer was also simple ‚Äî yes! So instead of giving a conference talk like I initially planned, on Friday 29th of March, I stood on an <a href=\"https://www.ccalfandegaporto.com/en/\">Alf√¢ndega do Porto</a> stage in front of hundreds of people being an MC of the initial <a href=\"https://typeofconf.com\">typeof</a> conference.

I am currently working on a transition from monolithic, outdated codebase to modern, serverless architecture for a huge UK based client (sorry, cannot reveal a name). I am extremely happy to have an opportunity to embrace the web from the backend perspective but the first few months were not smooth. Being surrounded by engineers familiar with concepts that I have never heard of wasn&rsquo;t fun. My understanding of the new stack quickly improved. I managed to transition anxiety to an opportunity to learn. I am glad and confident to say that I am a much better programmer than I use to be twelve months ago.</p>\n<p>For some people, &ldquo;work&rdquo; is something that only happens between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. That&rsquo;s not the case for me. I manage to accomplish some of the best pieces of productive work outside of these boundaries. The website that you are reading now has been created outside of my day-to-day job and has become one of my biggest achievements ever.

I am always surrounded by a bunch of good friends who I can count on. Despite some relationship ups and downs, <a href=\"https://zuzannarupinska.com\">Zuzanna</a> keeps tolerating her annoying boyfriend pretty well. One more thing! Our household recently welcomed this little princess ‚Äî her name is Yoko, she is messy as f**k and loves jumping on my face when I am asleep. Most charming pussycat ever!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-12-28-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"My cat Yoko\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"934\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Even living in the break-neck paced software industry, life would be boring without some non-technical passions. I neglected my passion for cycling for a few years and this year it has been reborn. A bunch of friends, hilly north England and my beloved titanium <a href=\"https://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/CBPXTEMV3FOR1700/planet-x-tempest-sram-force1-titanium-gravel-bike\">Planet X Tempest</a> gravel bike is everything that I need after a mind-bending week.

One routine that I managed to stick to very effectively is drinking 2500ml of water every single day. Since the beginning of a year, I haven&rsquo;t hit my target 4 times ‚Äî no real biggie. I created a simple iOS shortcut that helps me to track my daily intake in the Health app. I noticed a big improvement just by following this trivial habit. My skin looks healthier and my digestion is better. Drink water, please! No, coke doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>\n<p>My life is not always the land of milk and honey and there is one thing that makes me truly sad. Living in the UK for the last few years I truly miss my family and Szczecin ‚Äî  my hometown in Poland. There is nothing that I can do about it in my current life situation apart from trying to visit my beautiful country more often.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-12-28-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"My hometown Szczecin\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"934\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-2020-i-will\">In 2020 I will‚Ä¶ <a href=\"#in-2020-i-will\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I love planning some goals for the new year and put them down on a paper (pixels on the screen in this case). There are quite a few things that would be cool to cross off my bucket list soon.</p>\n<p>Professionally I want to grow, become a better developer, finish my side-project that I spent the last few months on and redesign this website. This website deserves some 2020 look and feel.</p>\n<p>Personally, I wish to lose some weight and keep this state instead of following this rollercoaster-like graph on Apple Health app. Smashing some 100km bike ride sounds like something that I would love to do. Following up my failure from the last year, half-marathon is still on the list to do. Surprisingly reading non-technical books helps me on professional and personal facets so I am planning to do it more often.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t know why but I have this gut feeling that 2020 will bring some big change in my life. I don&rsquo;t know what it is going to be but it is going to be big. Stay safe, healthy and keep on working on yourself. Until next time folks.</p>"},{"title":"Attach Visual Studio Code debugger to SAM (Serverless Application Model) local endpoint","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/attach-visual-studio-code-debugger-to-sam-serverless-application-model-local-endpoint/","pubDate":"Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/attach-visual-studio-code-debugger-to-sam-serverless-application-model-local-endpoint/","description":"<p>Hi!

Pay attention to <code>index.js.map</code> that lives directly next to the compiled version of a program ‚Äî otherwise, our debugger won&rsquo;t be able to map compiled code to the one inside <code>src</code> directory. Changes in files tree are reflected in the debugger config file that has been decorated with <code>outFiles</code> property that helps VSCode to identify the location of transpiled files.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-12-01-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Attach Viusal Studio Code debugger to TypeScript file\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"892\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Happy debugging!

We finally got a legit way of doing it right ‚Äî <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/\">CSS Grid Layout</a>.

Today we have a great <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid\">browser adoption for CSS Grid</a> and it gives me a wide smile on my face because I see more and more websites using it. It is close to impossible to show you a snippet that works as a holistic explainer because the specification is humongous. If you want to dip your toes into CSS Grid I cannot recommend enough <a href=\"https://cssgrid.io\">&ldquo;CSS Grid&rdquo; course</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos\">Wes Bos</a>. For people interested in the subject I recommend to follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelandrew\">Rachel Andrew</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jensimmons\">Jen Simmons</a> on Twitter. If you are after lazy copy-and-paste reference, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">&ldquo;A Complete Guide to Grid&rdquo;</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/css\">CSS Tricks</a> is everything you need.

This became a design restriction, so we got support for custom typefaces via <code>@font-face</code> at-rule. <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/\">CSS Fonts Module Level 4</a> adds a concept of Variable Fonts that puts custom fonts to the whole new level. Rather than fetching separate font file for every width, weight, or style, we get many different variations of a typeface incorporated into a single file. Performance without compromising design requirements at the same time ‚Äî yes, please! To control basic typeface characteristics (weight, width, slant, italic, and optical size) we can use one of the registered axes. On top of that typographers can register custom variation axis that gives them almost infinite possibilities. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpamental\">Jason Pamental</a> maintains an amazing resource titled <a href=\"https://rwt.io/typography-tips/variable-fonts-what-web-authors-need-know\">&ldquo;Variable Fonts: What web authors need to know&rdquo;</a> which is the best guide to use Variable Fonts. Presented on CSSconf EU 2019 by the same author <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0AsAjHPupKQ\">&ldquo;Modern Typographic Systems With Variable Fonts&rdquo;</a> is very informative talk for sexy typography fans.

You can partially blame me for that because I am the creator of one of the most popular carousel libraries out there ‚Äî <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema\">Siema.js</a>. Let me tell you a thing ‚Äî do not use it! All the JavaScript solution come with some sort of performance and accessibility drawbacks. <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-1/\">CSS Scroll Snap</a> is a native implementation that solves a majority of carousel-obsessed designers requirements. Even if your projects requirement is outside of boundaries of <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-snappoints\">browsers support range for CSS Scroll Snap</a> you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much. It gracefully falls back to regular scroll experience without breaking your layout whatsoever. Quick demo time.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">app</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">overflow-y</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">scroll</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">scroll-snap-type</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"kc\">mandatory</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">app__section</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">scroll-snap-align</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">start</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"css-logical-properties-and-values\">CSS Logical Properties and Values <a href=\"#css-logical-properties-and-values\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-logical-1/\">CSS Logical Properties and Values</a> enforce authors to control layout through logical, rather than physical direction and dimension mappings. It vastly improves working on projects that support multiple <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/\">writing modes</a>. For example, <code>border-inline-start</code> in <code>horizontal-tb</code> draws a border on the left-hand side of an element but for <code>vertical-lr</code> it will appear on the bottom of a node. This is a well-thought system designed with accessibility and internationalization in mind. I cannot recommend enough <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html\">&ldquo;CSS Logical Properties&rdquo; by Adrian Roselli</a> ‚Äì easily the best resource out there. This CodePen taken from Adrian&rsquo;s post is a fantastic visual explainer.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"position-sticky\">Position sticky <a href=\"#position-sticky\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t count how many approaches of building a sticky header element I came across during my career. They always relied on window sizes combined with <code>scroll</code> event. Later on, <code>IntersectionObserver</code> improved a bit ‚Äî if you are not familiar with this fantastic interface, you should give my <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/the-intersection-observer-api-explained/\">&ldquo;The Intersection Observer API explained&rdquo;</a> a read. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to achieve this effect using just CSS? Good news is coming ‚Äî it is possible now and the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky\">browser support for <code>position: sticky</code></a> is sufficient for some. Look how simple it is!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nt\">section</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">position</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">sticky</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">top</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"houdini\">Houdini <a href=\"#houdini\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This one deserves a whole separated article but briefly‚Ä¶ <a href=\"https://drafts.css-houdini.org\">Houdini</a> is a set of low-level APIs that exposes access to CSSOM (CSS Object Model) enabling developers to extend CSS by hooking into the styling and layout process of a browser‚Äôs engine. With this set of interfaces, only two restrictions come into play: your imagination and the browser support presented on <a href=\"https://ishoudinireadyyet.com\">&ldquo;Is Houdini ready yet‚ÄΩ&quot;</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DasSurma\">Surma</a>. To find out about the power of Houdini I highly encourage you to check <a href=\"https://css-houdini.rocks\">&ldquo;CSS Houdini Experiments&rdquo;</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamvdo\">Vincent De Oliveira</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GhRE3rML9t4\">&ldquo;CSS Houdini &amp; The Future of Styling by Una Kravets&rdquo;</a> is great and up-to-date introduction video.

Native feature detection that I elaborated on in my article <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/native-feature-detection-with-csssupports-api/\">&ldquo;Native feature detection with CSS.supports() API&rdquo;</a> is a CSS / JS native way to check if your browser supports feature of interest.

I see a significant amount of people working with <a href=\"https://postcss.org\">PostCSS</a> that deserves to make it to this list. Probably one of the most exciting recent events from this space is the announcement of Sass modules. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/author/miriam/\">Miriam Suzanne</a> posted recently <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/author/miriam/\">&ldquo;Introducing Sass Modules&rdquo;</a> on CSS Tricks that explains the concept (shouldn&rsquo;t be alien for JavaScript developers familiar with modules).</p>\n<h2 id=\"extra-stuff\">Extra stuff <a href=\"#extra-stuff\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I lot more stuff could be included on this list but I didn&rsquo;t want to make this article miles long.

Since OS X 10.2 Jaguar released in 2002 bash has been the primary operating system shell, so why all the sudden this change? Long story short ‚Äî licensing.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-06-06-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Bash in version 3.2.57 on macOS Mojave\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"794\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Newer versions of Bash are licensed under the GPLv3 (GNU General Public License version 3) which says you can&rsquo;t use it on a system that blocks 3rd party software installation. That&rsquo;s the reason why macOS stuck with 3.2.57 version released under GPLv2 which dates back to 2007. Licensed under the MIT License <a href=\"http://zsh.sourceforge.net\">Z shell</a> allows Apple to ship regular updates to this command language and keep a great level of compatibility with Bash.</p>\n<p>Because this is the future of my operating system, I spent some time to explore a new shell. Let me share with you how to do it and point out some things that I like the most about the new default shell language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change-your-default-shell\">Change your default shell <a href=\"#change-your-default-shell\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Fresh installation of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/\">macOS Catalina</a> will default to Z shell but an update from the previous version of Apple OS will persist your preference. It is very simple to update this setting though. You have a few options to do so: <code>chsh</code> CLI tool, Users &amp; Groups panel of System Preferences or Directory Utility built-in app.</p>\n<pre><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-06-06-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Change the default login shell on macOS\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1152\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"cool-things-about-zsh\">Cool things about zsh <a href=\"#cool-things-about-zsh\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>While zsh is mostly feature-compatible with bash there are some minor differences between them. On top of that modern Z shell comes with a lot of useful user experience improvements. Let me share a few of my favourite bits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexibility-and-open-source-resources\">Flexibility and open-source resources <a href=\"#flexibility-and-open-source-resources\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Z shell comes with tons of <a href=\"http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#Options\">options</a> that allow you to make your prompt really yours. If you are not a big fan of crafting config files manually, there is several popular open-source tools that help you manage your Zsh configuration. Bundled with hundreds of helpers, plugins and themes <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh My ZSH</a> is by far the most popular one.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-06-06-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Several great zsh frameworks\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1258\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"supercharged-auto-completion\">Supercharged auto-completion <a href=\"#supercharged-auto-completion\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Not only can you skip <code>cd</code> to change your current working directory but you can type a path in an extremely lazy way and press then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tab<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. No need for <code>cd Sites/projectname/src</code> anymore because <code>s/p/s</code> is more than enough. This feature is enabled by default on Oh My ZSH framework but you can control it manually using <a href=\"http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#Description-of-Options-1\"><code>AUTO_CD</code></a> option. Look!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-06-06-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Supercharged auto-completion with zsh\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"780\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>This feature is mind-bending.

This feature is part of Oh My ZSH.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-06-06-5.gif\"\n  alt=\"Supercharged auto-completion with zsh\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"discover-a-commands-options--flags\">Discover a commands options / flags <a href=\"#discover-a-commands-options--flags\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There is no need to check the man page of a particular command to find a flag that you want to pass.

Type alias declarations can create a name for all kind of types including primitives (<code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code> and <code>number</code>), union, and intersection types. In a way, this difference makes the <code>type</code> more flexible. In theory every type declaration that you can express with an <code>interface</code>, you can recreate using a <code>type</code> alias. Lets have a look at an example that can be represented using a <code>type</code> alias but is beyond the power of an <code>interface</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-ts\" data-lang=\"ts\"><span class=\"nx\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">info</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span>: <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"p\">};</span>\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"you-can-merge-interfaces-but-not-types\">You can merge interfaces but not types <a href=\"#you-can-merge-interfaces-but-not-types\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Multiple declarations with the same name are valid only when used with <code>interface</code>.

Since I wrote this article, TypeScript behavior changed slightly and now the resolution of both (types and interfaces) happens in the same phase. Looks like both of them are deferred so the example from the image below is now perfectly valid TypeScript code.</p>\n\n<p><del>Another difference is when a type is resolved by the compiler. Resolution of an <code>interface</code> is deferred, means that you can use them to recursively chain types. Resolution of <code>type</code> aliases is eager and compiler goes crazy when you try to resolve recursively nested types. Look!</del></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-ts\" data-lang=\"ts\"><span class=\"nx\">type</span> <span class=\"nx\">Dude</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">string</span> <span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"nx\">Pals</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kr\">interface</span> <span class=\"nx\">Pals</span> <span class=\"kr\">extends</span> <span class=\"nb\">Array</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">Dude</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p><del>We are allowed to do it, because type of <code>interface</code>s is deferred.

As an active open source contributor I see some advantages of using <code>interface</code> for authoring a public API and I tend to use it more often. The <code>type</code> alias is irreplaceable in some circumstances mentioned in this article. Most importantly ‚Äî keep it consistent.

Luckily I&rsquo;ve found myself being a part of a team of super talented people working on serverless microservices on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS (Amazon Web Services) platform</a>. Having no previous experience in this field, let me share with you what I&rsquo;ve learnt during my initial exploration into this arena and build a little serverless app with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites <a href=\"#prerequisites\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have one, go ahead and <a href=\"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup\">create an AWS account</a>. A credit card is needed to set one up, but be assured that you won&rsquo;t be charged a single penny for the stuff that I will go through here as the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/\">AWS free tier</a> is pretty generous.</p>\n<p>AWS Lambda supports multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Go and C#) so a rudimental understanding of any of these is necessary. I will be using JavaScript in this tutorial.</p>\n<p>Familiarity with the command line, a code editor and a REST client will help you to create, deploy and test your application. If you don&rsquo;t have a preference, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href=\"https://insomnia.rest/\">Insomnia</a> ‚Äî both of these tools are free, easy to use and very feature-full.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Screenshot of AWS account, Visual Studio Code and Insomnia website\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1337\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"stack\">Stack <a href=\"#stack\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The AWS platform contains hundreds of services which are categorised into tens of different types. We are going to use only a few of them without needing to ever visit the not-so-intuitive web interface ‚Äî we&rsquo;ll do it like the pros! We are going to use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface</a> to manage all the services. Lets have a closer look at what we need.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS services in use\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1850\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <a href=\"#amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a>, being the oldest tool on the platform, allows the user to store objects of any kind inside <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html\">&ldquo;buckets&rdquo;</a>. You can use it to store the source files of your website, securely hold some private documents or as a <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/\">photo backup solution</a>.</p>\n<p>We are going to use this service to store a bundled zip file containing some project files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aws-lambda\">AWS Lambda <a href=\"#aws-lambda\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> is a computing power provider that removes the overhead of server maintenance ‚Äî that&rsquo;s the reason why its functions are termed &ldquo;serverless&rdquo;. Lambda functions are stateless and can be invoked using multiple triggers, for example: a database stream, an API request or an event emited by other AWS services. Lambdas are very cost effective because we only pay for the computational duration ‚Äî not for any idle time.</p>\n<p>We are going to use this service to compute the final output based on the input sent within a <code>POST</code> request. To create the REST APIs we are going to use‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3 id=\"amazon-api-gateway\">Amazon API Gateway <a href=\"#amazon-api-gateway\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">Amazon API Gateway</a> allows users to create, maintain, and secure APIs. It is extremely easy to use. Creating endpoints and attaching the HTTP verbs (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>) to it has never been easier.</p>\n<p>We are going to use this service to define an endpoint that triggers a lambda function with a defined payload ‚Äî the body of a <code>POST</code> request.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aws-identity-and-access-management-iam\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href=\"#aws-identity-and-access-management-iam\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Having an account doesn&rsquo;t give you access to whatever you want, only the things that your role allows you to do. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> is a service to manage only that ‚Äî access to AWS services and resources.</p>\n<p>We are going to use this service to create an account that allows us to manage AWS services using a CLI (programmatic access). Implicitly a new role that allows a Lambda function interact with other services will be created.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aws-cloudformation\">AWS Cloud‚ÄãFormation <a href=\"#aws-cloudformation\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS Cloud‚ÄãFormation</a> is the best! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code\">Infrastructure as code, also referred to as IaC</a>, allows the user to describe and provision all of the infrastructure resources.</p>\n<p>We are going to use this service to describe all of the resources for the app inside a single YAML file (JSON format is supported as well). A &ldquo;stack&rdquo; of services created using Cloud‚ÄãFormation is very easy to deploy, update and delete.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aws-cli-setup\">AWS CLI setup <a href=\"#aws-cli-setup\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Although it is possible to do everything that we need using the AWS console (website interface) I strongly suggest using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS CLI</a>. It is a very powerful, fast and easy-to-use command line tool. If you have read some of my previous articles, you know that <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/homebrew-the-best-friend-of-the-macos-user/\">I love Homebrew</a> so I am going to use it to install AWS CLI. Installation instructions for other operating systems are provided on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">official AWS CLI website</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>brew install awscli\n</code></pre><p>A new <code>aws</code> command is ready to use but it doesn&rsquo;t know how to speak to our account yet. To fix this we need to configure the CLI. Before doing so, please make sure that you have a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html\">IAM user</a> with programmatic access and sufficient privileges created. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html\">Creating an IAM User in Your AWS Account</a> is well documented on an official documentation. If this is in place, you should have your <code>aws_access_key_id</code> and <code>aws_secret_access_key</code> that enables you to grant programmatic access. Configure your default account using the <code>aws configure</code> command.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Configure AWS CLI tool\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"848\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>This setup creates a <code>.aws</code> directory in your user root location (<code>~/.aws</code>) with two files: <code>credentials</code> and <code>config</code>. You can add as many users as you want using the <code>configure</code> command. To find out more about creating new users and particular options, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\">&ldquo;Configuring the AWS CLI&rdquo;</a> section on the official documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-a-serverless-greetings-app\">Build a serverless greetings app <a href=\"#build-a-serverless-greetings-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The function of this app will be to send your name and get some kind of greeting back. I know, it&rsquo;s a dumb example, but the concepts and tools that we are going to use are a great basis for your million dollar, serverless project.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Screenshot of an app example inside Insomnia REST client\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1048\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s create a directory and place two files in it ‚Äî <code>index.js</code> and <code>template.yaml</code>. The JavaScript file describes the business logic and <code>template.yaml</code> is needed to define the resources of the AWS stack.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">mkdir hi <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> hi <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> touch index.js template.yaml\n</code></pre></div><pre><code>hi/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.yaml\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"create-the-lambda-function\">Create the Lambda function <a href=\"#create-the-lambda-function\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html\">A Lambda function signature in Node.js</a> is straight forward. It takes three arguments: <code>event</code> for the data provided from the trigger, <code>context</code> which stores information about the execution environment and an optional <code>callback</code> function very commonly used in Node.js.

A simple file that describes the whole architecture that&rsquo;s easy to deploy, update and delete. The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html\">anatomy of a CloudFormation template</a> is simple and becomes as complex as your projects needs to be.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"c\"># template.yaml</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\"></span><span class=\"k\">Transform</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>AWS<span class=\"p\">::</span>Serverless<span class=\"m\">-2016-10-31</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\"></span><span class=\"k\">Resources</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">Greetings</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">Type</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>AWS<span class=\"p\">::</span>Serverless<span class=\"p\">::</span>Function<span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">Properties</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"k\">Handler</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>index.handler<span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"k\">Runtime</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>nodejs8<span class=\"m\">.10</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"k\">Events</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">HelloWorldApi</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">          </span><span class=\"k\">Type</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>Api<span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">          </span><span class=\"k\">Properties</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"k\">Path</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>/<span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"k\">Method</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>POST<span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div><p>The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-section-structure.html\"><code>Transform</code> section</a> defines the macros that AWS CloudFormation uses to process your template. <code>AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31</code> means that the template is written in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html#lang/en_us\">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a> syntax. It simplifies the declaration of a Lambda function and its execution role. Without this transformation, CloudFormation templates are much more verbose.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html\"><code>Resources</code> section</a> is the only required section and defines stack resources and their properties. In our case the only resource is a <code>AWS::Serverless::Function</code> described by a <code>Greetings</code> logical ID. Properties define the path to a <code>handler</code>, runtime and event that triggers an invocation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"package-the-serverless-app\">Package the serverless app <a href=\"#package-the-serverless-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>One of the AWS services that I mentioned we are going to use is S3. We need a bucket to store the bundled application files. The AWS CLI <code>mb</code> command comes in handy when we need to create one (<code>mb</code> probably stands for &ldquo;make bucket&rdquo;). Keep in mind that the name of every bucket in S3 must be unique. I have one called <code>pawelgrzybek-cloudformation</code> where I store all of my cloudformation stacks.</p>\n<pre><code>aws s3 mb s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\n</code></pre><p>Now everything&rsquo;s ready it&rsquo;s time to package things up. The AWS CLI comes with a helpful command that bundles all the resources in a zip file, sends it to S3, adds a bucket location path to the output template file and returns a copy of it. We are going to use a new file (<code>packaged.yaml</code>) to deploy the app in a further step.</p>\n<pre><code>aws cloudformation package --template-file template.yaml --output-template-file packaged.yaml --s3-bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS CLI ‚Äî CloudFormation package output\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1252\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-6.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS Console S3 ‚Äî Confirmation that package has been uploaded successfully\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"922\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"deploy-serverless-app\">Deploy serverless app <a href=\"#deploy-serverless-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Now all the files are on a S3 bucket and we have a <code>packaged.yaml</code> file that contains the information about its resources.

To authorise a stack to do so, we need to add <code>--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM</code>. The <code>--stack-name</code> allows us to create a custom name for the stack ‚Äî the name of my stack is &ldquo;hi&rdquo;. Confirm the deployment of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation stack section.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-8.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS Console CloudFormation Stacks ‚Äî Confirmation that package has been deployed successfully\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"922\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>The stacks &ldquo;resources&rdquo; tab clearly shows us all of the resources that have been created to deploy the app and link the services together: Lambda function, API Gateway, IAM role and a bunch of permission and deployment-related stuff that the SAM transformation created for us.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-9.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS Console CloudFormation Stack ‚Äî Resources tab\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1600\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-the-serverless-app\">Test the serverless app <a href=\"#test-the-serverless-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The API defined as an event for our <code>Greetings</code> Lambda function implicitly created an endpoint and two stages for it: &ldquo;Prod&rdquo; (default) and &ldquo;Stage&rdquo;. We can find more details about the created endpoint in the Amazon API Gateway Stages tab. One of the things that we can find here is a URL to hit that in turn invokes a function. The page for the individual Lambda function is another place where we can find information about the URL endpoint that works as a function trigger.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-10.jpg\"\n  alt=\"AWS Gateway API ‚Äî find and endpoint that triggers Lambda function\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"893\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>It is finally time to test our app. Let&rsquo;s do it using your REST API client of choice by passing a JSON body with a <code>name</code> key.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-03-19-11.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The result of our first serverless application\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1720\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html\">AWS SAM CLI</a> allows us to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-invoke.html\">test Lambda functions locally</a> but this is out of the scope of this article. I may publish a separate article about working with the AWS Serverless Application Model Framework one day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-done\">All done! <a href=\"#all-done\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It has been quite a long ride, but I hope it has helped you to get an idea about building serverless apps on the AWS platform. Extending this project with additional parts is just a matter of adding new resources to a <code>template.yaml</code> file. Need a database? <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a> is a great option. Need to be notified via SMS about some changes on your S3 bucket? <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Amazon Simple Notification Service</a> is your best friend. Would you like to take your smart home to the next level? You should have a look at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iot/\">AWS IoT</a>. The sky is the limit.</p>\n<p>Although the AWS platform is not the only provider that let&rsquo;s you build serverless apps, it is the one that I ended up using and liking a lot. Feel free to have a look at the extremely nice to use <a href=\"https://serverless.com/\">Serverless framework</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/features/functions/\">Netlify Functions</a> that are great and easy abstractions on top of the AWS Lambdas or <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/\">Azure Functions</a> that are equally powerful.</p>\n<p>Let me know your thoughts and feel free to share some serverless article ideas that you would like to read about next time.

Installation itself is very straight forward ‚Äî next, next, next, done.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-01-15-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Node.js pre-built installer\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1464\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Despite the fact it is the easiest way of installing it, it comes with many disadvantages. It locks you to a particular version ‚Äî it may not be a big issue on day one but it can be in the long run if you are willing to jump between projects that depend on different versions. Another (worst) issue with this method is the fact that it requires admin permissions (<code>sudo</code>) to install package globally. I published <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/fix-priviliges-and-never-again-use-sudo-with-npm/\">&ldquo;Fix privileges and never again use sudo with npm&rdquo;</a> with some solutions for this issue, but you better check <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally\">&ldquo;Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally&rdquo;</a> on official documentation or follow this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node-from-homebrew--chocolatey\">Node from Homebrew / Chocolatey <a href=\"#node-from-homebrew--chocolatey\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/homebrew-the-best-friend-of-the-macos-user/\">&ldquo;Homebrew ‚Äî the best friend of the macOS user&rdquo;</a> explains why I love this tool so much. Windows users can find an alternative like <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/\">Chocolatey</a>. Both of these package managers allow you to install Node.js with ease.</p>\n<pre><code>brew install node\n</code></pre><pre><code>choco install nodejs.install\n</code></pre><p>CLI tools like that allow you to install / uninstall software in no time and never again be bothered by insufficient permissions.

Although it is available for macOS and Linux only, <a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows\">Node.js version manager for Windows</a> exists (ironically it is written in Go). Installation is straightforward ‚Äî you can use a simple bash script or <code>brew</code> (my preferred way).</p>\n<pre><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre><pre><code>brew install nvm\n</code></pre><p>Thats the way to install the latest version of Node.js.</p>\n<pre><code>nvm install node\n</code></pre><p>Be curious and explore more <code>nvm</code> commands on an <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage\">official nvm documentation</a>. My most frequently used commands are: <code>install</code>, <code>uninstall</code>, <code>list</code> and <code>use</code>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2019-01-15-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"NVM (Node Version Manager) ‚Äî list all the installed versions\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"900\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>It is hard to remember the version of Node.js that a project depends on ‚Äî smash the version into <code>.nvmrc</code> file in the root of your project and run <code>nvm use</code> inside this directory. If something can be automated, it should be automated ‚Äî installing the right version of dependencies is not an exception. I made a simple bash script that runs <code>nvm use</code> whenever it encounters a <code>.nvmrc</code> file inside your project. There is a cool <a href=\"https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm\">zsh-nvm plugin for Zsh users</a> that does the same job.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2018 December","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2018-december/","pubDate":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2018-december/","description":"<h2 id=\"microsoft-is-building-a-chromium-powered-web-browser-that-will-replace-edge-on-windows-10httpswwwwindowscentralcommicrosoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10\">Microsoft is building a Chromium-powered web browser that will replace Edge on Windows 10</a> <a href=\"#microsoft-is-building-a-chromium-powered-web-browser-that-will-replace-edge-on-windows-10httpswwwwindowscentralcommicrosoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Chromium based Anaheim is going to replace Microsoft Edge that will land on a Windows 10 at some point in 2019.

I won&rsquo;t get the chance to use all the hot frameworks from the top of Hacker News and there is no chance I&rsquo;ll attend all the cool conferences around the world.

I can&rsquo;t tell you more just now but be assured it will be very cool.</p>\n<p>Looking at the personal aspects of my life there is a thing that I am truly unhappy about and this is my biggest challenge in the upcoming months. I am not feeling happy on my own body. My weight is like a little roller coaster, and consequently so is my mental comfort. I am definitely missing some regular activity that could help my body to recover its shape and my brain to not let me down for no particular reason. I want my six-pack back.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, this time next year I would like to confirm again that I am truly happy man.

A number of popular projects use this pattern: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux\">React Redux</a>, <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/relay/\">Relay</a> or <a href=\"https://formidable.com/open-source/radium/\">Radium</a> just to name a few. They are easy to compose, use and chain together. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acdlite\">Andrew Clark</a> from the React core team, being a strong advocate of this composition, created a popular utility library called <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/recompose\">recompose</a>. The active maintenance of it has been discontinued because of the recently announced Hooks that solve the majority of the issues that this library tried to help with (more on that later).</p>\n<h3 id=\"cons-of-using-hoc\">Cons of using HOC <a href=\"#cons-of-using-hoc\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There is no rose without a thorn. Chained higher order components can lead to prop naming collisions ‚Äî technically there is nothing incorrect about the implementation but unexpected results are painful to debug. When overused it is hard to guess where a particular prop is coming from and going through a nested tree in the console isn&rsquo;t a pleasant experience. Some rare issues with using them inside a <code>render()</code>, class static methods and passing <code>ref</code>s are well detailed in the React docs under the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats\">Higher-Order Components ‚Äî Caveats</a> section.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjackson\">Michael Jackson</a>, creator of <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\">React Router</a> and a few other popular open source projects pointed out a lot of issues with HOCs in his talk <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BcVAq3YFiuc\">&ldquo;Never Write Another HoC&rdquo;</a> presented at Phoenix ReactJS in September 2017.

Despite the fact that the Hooks API adds 1,5kb to the gzipped React codebase, in the scale of real life projects the minified results shows some impressive bundle size reductions (based on some early tests of some brave community members).

Every abstraction comes with some cost. Which of these patters you are going to follow is just a question of personal preference.

Bookmarking them all in a browser built-in feature is an option but it quickly becomes unmanageable after a while. A myriad of bookmarking services have been born to solve this issue and my favourite amongst them is <a href=\"http://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a> built by Maciej Ceg≈Çowski. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t the prettiest website around neither is the API the cleanest and most intuitive but it definitely comes with one big advantage ‚Äî it works.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is absolutely nothing interesting about the Pinboard architecture or implementation; I consider that a feature!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a few years of working with Pinboard, my collection has grown a lot, getting bigger day by day while I visit resources I don&rsquo;t want to lose. Adding new and browsing existing internet resources is what bookmarking services should do effectively ‚Äî unfortunately, I identified some Pinboard issues regarding user interface usability. There are few browser plugins that make your life easier but they all seemed to steer away from solving these issues.</p>\n<p>I had a few technologies I wanted to play with and I knew a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript too ‚Äî which is all you need to build a browser extension.

It is fully keyboard accessible, configurable and comes with a plain design well-known from Pinboard website. Let me go through a few aspects of this tool in more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"api-token-to-authenticate\">API token to authenticate <a href=\"#api-token-to-authenticate\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>PinBuddy never asks you for your personal authentication credentials ‚Äî it uses a dedicated API token to authenticate that you are you. You can find your personal token on the <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/settings/password\">setting page under the password tab</a>. This short identifier can be invalidated and regenerated on user request at any time.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-10-16-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"PinBuddy uses API token to authenticate\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1624\"\n  height=\"1324\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable\">Configurable <a href=\"#configurable\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Options page allows you to log out and configure a few very useful settings that may boost your productivity.

The long description is optional and can be fetched based on user cursor selection. Handy, isn&rsquo;t it? Tags are probably the field you will edit the most.

Unfortunately these innovations will introduce some breaking changes therefore we should expect them in next major release.

It normally comes with a bunch of dependencies developed by other developers and we need a way to track the versions of them. Following a meaningful convention helps to track software progress and avoid API collisions. Adopted by multiple ecosystems and software architectures <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning (commonly called SemVer)</a> helps with this.</p>\n<p>The <code>major.minor.patch</code> notation comes with a ton of information about the software. Let me guide you through the individual components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>major</code> - introduces non-backward-compatible changes to the API</li>\n<li><code>minor</code> - introduces backward-compatible changes to the API</li>\n<li><code>mpatch</code> - introduces bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Versioning starts at <code>0.1.0</code> ‚Äî unfortunately, however, package creators don&rsquo;t always follow this guideline. Everything lower than <code>1.0.0</code> indicates the software is in its development phase. Version <code>1.0.0</code> is the one that is ready to share with other developers ‚Äî this rule is not always followed by the end user though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-ranges\">Version ranges <a href=\"#version-ranges\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a> (the package manager used by Ruby developers) ranges are commonly used to represent a version scope. Have you ever seen <code>-</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> in the version descriptor? This is exactly what I am talking about. For instance <code>&gt;=1.3.3 &lt;=2.4.7</code> matches anything from (and including) <code>1.3.3</code> all the way up to (and including) <code>2.4.7</code>.</p>\n<p>There are a few range descriptors introduced by the node ecosystem that aren&rsquo;t that self explanatory. Have you ever seen <code>*</code>, <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of a dependency version? Let me help you to embrace these symbols.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>*</code> - update to the latest version (including major)</li>\n<li><code>^</code> - update to the latest minor release</li>\n<li><code>~</code> - update to the latest patch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s use the current React 16.4.2 as an example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the--range-specifier\">The * range specifier <a href=\"#the--range-specifier\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;dependencies&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;react&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;*&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend using <code>*</code> in your client-facing software - ever. It may cause unpredictable consequences if the API changes drastically. In this case it means the dependency should always update to the latest stable version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-caret--range-specifier\">The caret ^ range specifier <a href=\"#the-caret--range-specifier\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;dependencies&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;react&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;^16.4.0&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>This notation accepts all versions that span <code>&gt;=16.4.0 &lt;17.0.0</code>.

After shooting analog using a Hasselblad 500C/M for years I recently became the happy owner of a <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3\">Sony Œ±7R III</a>. As far as shooting goes on an advanced camera like this it is pure pleasure. To take a good picture you need to have a good eye ‚Äî this applies to both analog and digital worlds. The differences start after pressing the shutter button when instead of going to the darkroom, everything goes to software.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"RAW image processors\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"456\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Having had some minor experience with Adobe Camera RAW many years ago, it was a fascinating moment when I had to embrace the world of digital photography in 2018. There are tons of software applications available on the market: <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Adobe Lightroom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dxo.com/us/photography/photo-software/dxo-photolab\">DxO PhotoLab</a> or <a href=\"https://skylum.com/luminar\">Luminar</a> to name a few big players. All of them are superb but there is always something that I dislike about each one: the pricing model, the performance, a missing feature, lack of camera support etc. There is one that does everything right though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"capture-one-pro-by-phase-one\">Capture One Pro by Phase One <a href=\"#capture-one-pro-by-phase-one\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx\">Capture One</a> is designed by the Copenhagen (Denmark) based team of people from Phase One ‚Äî the field leader when it comes to medium format digital photography systems. Years of creating the best photography hardware gave this bunch of people the foundation on which to extend their prowess by offering a piece of powerful and precise software. Let me share with you a few reasons why I decided to invest my time and money in their product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"price\">Price <a href=\"#price\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Sony-Pro.aspx\">Capture One Express</a> is the free version of the software for Sony camera owners. For the majority of users it will be more than enough but to get access to the more powerful features I upgraded to <a href=\"https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Features.aspx\">version Pro</a>. There are multiple options in terms of pricing ‚Äî I ended up buying the full license for Sony cameras for only ¬£89. Unfortunately this attractive price applies only to the version for Sony cameras. Another good reason to go with mirrorless Sony? Hahaha!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Capture One pricing model\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1220\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"learning-resources\">Learning resources <a href=\"#learning-resources\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A piece of software with this level of complexity always presents a learning curve ‚Äî Capture One Pro is no different. <a href=\"https://learn.phaseone.com/\">Learning hub</a> contains a comprehensive list of learning resources for beginners, intermediate and advanced users. The method of app exploration that I like the most are the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZS3EGK3tQ9eNptYkVQlh9hTZ6d-rNOU\">webinars hosted by David Grover</a>. These lengthy screencasts are just the perfect combination of comprehensive explainers and practical implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Capture One learning resources\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"881\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"sessions\">Sessions <a href=\"#sessions\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Having disorganised files all over the place is not the best way to keep your collection neat. Having them all in one single catalogue (Lightroom style) doesn&rsquo;t suit my workflow either. I just want to have a separate event or trip in an encapsulated folder. The new way of organising files announced in Capture One 10 called &ldquo;Sessions&rdquo; is exactly what I&rsquo;m after. With this workflow, every single session becomes well structured and portable in a folder that contains all of my images and adjustments. It perfectly fits into <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/\">my Amazon S3 photo backup solution</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NdsMo0mKgy4\">There is a webinar</a> that thoroughly explains the use case for sessions.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Sessions in Capture One Pro\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"856\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"customisation\">Customisation <a href=\"#customisation\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Despite the user interface looking a little bit outdated at first glance, this is probably the most customisable piece of software on my hard drive. You can truly make it yours. The default layout puts everything in a well-thought-out order that works well for me. Following the tabs from left to right, from import to export you have access to hundreds of little adjustments. A little bit of practice and a few keyboard shortcuts built into your muscle memory lets you forget about the tool and stay focused on what matters ‚Äî the photography.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance\">Performance <a href=\"#performance\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I am not running the most expensive, latest iMac Pro with a superb powerful GPU and gazillions of RAM. I am on a three year old MacBook Pro 15 with 16GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pro 1536MB and this application flies! It requires a few seconds of indexing on the initial setup but then my workflow is buttery smooth. I was pretty happy with the performance of version 10, but this is significantly improved in the latest release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"process-recipes\">Process recipes <a href=\"#process-recipes\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>One for print, another version for my website and of course one to land on Instagram. Literally three clicks! Process recipes are very customisable, easy to use, intuitive to create and ready to exchange between devices. Literally no other app does it right ‚Äî Capture One nailed it.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Process recipes in Capture One Pro\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"856\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"layers\">Layers <a href=\"#layers\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can add up to 16 layers, control their opacity and add literally everything on them (apart from black &amp; white adjustments and spot removal). The concept of layers is nothing new in graphic design software, but it opens a new level of flexibility in the world of RAW processors. Find out more about <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2WHpVfgC5Qc\">working with layers</a> in this webinar.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-08-06-6.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Layers panel in Capture One Pro\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"856\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-color-editor--skin-tone\">Advanced Color Editor &amp; Skin Tone <a href=\"#advanced-color-editor--skin-tone\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The simplicity of using the advanced color editor and skin tone tool in Capture One Pro makes these two features amongst my favourite parts of this software. To achieve similar results in a tool like Photoshop, you need to have lots of color theory knowledge and probably be crazy good at math. Find out more about this in another great webinar by David ‚Äî <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZlBLEXe4rPA\">The Color Editor Master Class</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"give-it-a-go\">Give it a go! <a href=\"#give-it-a-go\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is more to it, but I&rsquo;ve tried hard to pick my favourite parts of the app without making this article miles long. I cannot wait for new releases and new feature announcements. I would like to have a tiny UI update to make it look a bit more like 2018. The history panel (in the style of Luminar 2018) would be a nice feature to have. Also I would like to see a more intuitive way to preview before and after changes (I know about clicking the reset button and holding the option key, but a dedicated button would be very appreciated).</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a sponsored post whatsoever and I don&rsquo;t work for Capture One (but I would love to though!). I just really love this software and I wanted to share with you my experience with it. I am very curious about your opinions, favourite parts, and other software that you use.

There must be a better way than doing all these things manually!

As a macOS user <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is the one that I will guide you through, but I am sure that you can follow along and find the equivalent commands for your operating system of choice.</p>\n<p>Programming languages have their own ecosystems and their own package managers to manage project components. For example, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a> and <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">Yarn</a> are commonly used by JavaScript developers, <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> makes the life of PHP developers much easier and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pip/\">Pip</a> is the best friend of Python developers.

I resisted using it for years because I didn&rsquo;t understand the geeky terminology. I will do my best to help you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>search for stuff</li>\n<li>install / uninstall stuff</li>\n<li>install / uninstall macOS app</li>\n<li>upgrade package / macOS app</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before doing so, we need one thing. We need <code>brew</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"install-brew\">Install Brew <a href=\"#install-brew\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I recently joined a <a href=\"https://mindera.com/\">new company</a>, where I got a new MacBook. Intuitively I tried to install <code>brew</code> via <code>brew</code> ‚Äî this is how using it is now melded to my muscle memory. Of course this command didn&rsquo;t work so I had to visit the <a href=\"https://brew.sh/#install\">Homebrew installation guide</a> to copy a one-liner and paste it into my Terminal. I <code>brew</code>ed the rest afterwards.</p>\n<pre><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"search-for-stuff-via-homebrew\">Search for stuff via Homebrew <a href=\"#search-for-stuff-via-homebrew\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can find tons of things on Homebrew! The default <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula\">homebrew-core repository</a> contains thousands of formulas and new ones are added everyday. A formula is just a fancy name for a little Ruby script that contains enough of information to download a package on to your machine. To look for a package of interest you can manually browse the repository (never do it like that), use the <a href=\"http://searchbrew.com/\">online Brew Search</a> or use the command line. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay\"><code>cowsay</code></a> is the most useless piece of software ever ‚Äî I love it and I will use it as an example.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-07-05-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Search packages via Homebrew\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"881\"\n/>\n</p>\n<pre><code>brew search cowsay\n</code></pre><p>By default Homebrew uses a list of formulas included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula\">homebrew-core repository</a>, but you may face a situation when it is not enough. By adding <a href=\"https://docs.brew.sh/Taps\">taps (third-party repositories)</a> you can extend the list of packages available to <code>brew</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"install--uninstall-stuff-via-homebrew\">Install / uninstall stuff via Homebrew <a href=\"#install--uninstall-stuff-via-homebrew\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The most frequently used commands are <code>install</code> and <code>uninstall</code>. Let&rsquo;s use the <code>cowsay</code> package as an example.</p>\n<pre><code>brew install cowsay\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-07-05-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Cowsay in action\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1204\"\n/>\n</p>\n<pre><code>brew uninstall cowsay\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"install--remove-a-macos-app-via-homebrew\">Install / remove a macOS app via Homebrew <a href=\"#install--remove-a-macos-app-via-homebrew\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Since version 0.9.5 Homebrew comes with something called <code>brew cask</code>. It allows you to install macOS applications, fonts and drivers. You can browse all the available casks on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks\">homebrew-cask repo</a> or search it via the command line. For example <code>brew search atom</code>. To install it‚Ä¶</p>\n<pre><code>brew cask install atom\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-07-05-4.gif\"\n  alt=\"Install Atom via command line\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"870\"\n  height=\"634\"\n/>\n</p>\n<pre><code>brew cask uninstall atom\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"upgrade-package--macos-app-via-homebrew\">Upgrade package / macOS app via Homebrew <a href=\"#upgrade-package--macos-app-via-homebrew\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Of course we want the latest and greatest software on our machines. It couldn&rsquo;t be easier to update our packages ‚Äî <code>brew upgrade</code> is all that we need. Similarly to bump the version of our graphical apps we can use <code>brew cask upgrade</code>. Follow these commands with the name of a formula if you want to update an individual package.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that <code>brew update</code> is not an alias of <code>brew upgrade</code> ‚Äî it fetches the newest formulas from GitHub but doesn&rsquo;t do anything to your brews.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brew-everything\">Brew everything <a href=\"#brew-everything\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Hopefully this article helped you out and demystified the power that Homebrew comes with. I&rsquo;ve helped you to explore some very basic commands, but please don&rsquo;t stop here. Look for some more sophisticated use cases in the <a href=\"https://docs.brew.sh/\">official documentation</a>. I use it extensively in my daily routine but also to install <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles/blob/master/setup-brew.sh\">my favourite software</a> every time I jump on a new machine.

Having a good IDE helps a ton. <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio</a> by Microsoft, the superb <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\">CLion</a> by JetBrains or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a> are great choices to consider. The compiled nature of this language will require you to brush up on some basic knowledge about memory allocation and the architecture that you are working on and building for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-c-makes-you-a-better-javascript-developer\">Learning C++ makes you a better JavaScript developer <a href=\"#learning-c-makes-you-a-better-javascript-developer\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One of the plethora use cases of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language\">low-level programming languages</a> like C++ is building other programming languages. Yes, you guessed it ‚Äî JavaScript is written in C++. To be precise, the engines that drive the most popular JavaScript engines (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/v8/\">V8</a> within Google Chrome and Node, <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore\">Chakra</a> for Microsoft and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey\">SpiderMonkey</a> for Mozilla products) are mainly compiled from a C++ code base. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">MDN Web Docs</a> is a fantastic resource and I use it all the time but sometimes it is not enough. I cannot describe how cool it is to read V8&rsquo;s source code and actually understand what is going on.</p>\n<p>Having exposure to a strongly-typed programming language (one that requires data type declaration) and a basic understanding of memory management makes you think about your script in a totally different way. Despite the fact that JavaScript engines are doing tons of optimisations for you, you can avoid performance pitfalls by writing an API that skips unnecessary steps at runtime. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathias\">Mathias Bynens from V8 team</a> recently gave a fantastic talk on this subject ‚Äî <a href=\"https://youtu.be/m9cTaYI95Zc\">V8 internals for JavaScript developers</a>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9cTaYI95Zc\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"leaving-javascript-fatigue-behind\">Leaving JavaScript fatigue behind <a href=\"#leaving-javascript-fatigue-behind\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I bet that a new JavaScript framework will land on GitHub before you reach the end of this article. But I just learnt React. Damn! My <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/howto/#saving\">Pinboard reading list</a> is full of JS related articles, tweets, conference talks and tutorials on YouTube! There is no way that I will keep up with this endless dungeon of JavaScript resources.</p>\n<p>Actually there is a way to get out of JS fatigue! Forget about your current stack and let yourself soak in a new skill (C++ in my case). Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still learn new JavaScript stuff on daily basis but only when I really need it. I ignore tweets about new libraries and frameworks, tutorials on Youtube and Medium articles. Ironically ‚Äî accordingly to section above ‚Äî doing so makes you a better JavaScript developer anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helpful-resources\">Helpful resources <a href=\"#helpful-resources\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For me the most efficient way of learning is watching videos with a great balance between theoretical definitions and practical examples. It took me quite a while to find some great resources about C++ and after a few months I&rsquo;m ready to share with you my top ones!</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb\">C++ playlist</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecherno\">Yan Chernikov</a> is one of the best resources that I&rsquo;ve found. It has a good balance between theory and practice, it keeps an optimal pace and is interspersed with a great sense of humour that makes it a perfect stating point for C++ newcomers. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M\">C++ playlist by Derek Banas</a> is another one that is a little less energetic but filled with great theoretical explanations.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-06-01-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"C&#43;&#43; Playlists on YouTube\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1066\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever I struggle with a particular subject I dig into <a href=\"http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html\">The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup</a>. This publication is written in an academic manner by the author of the C++ language.

An <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache HTTP server</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL database</a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/\">PHP programming language</a> is all that we need and, believe it or not, your Apple computer comes with the majority of these elements baked in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configure-an-apache-http-server-and-enable-php\">Configure an Apache HTTP server and enable PHP <a href=\"#configure-an-apache-http-server-and-enable-php\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Apache HTTP Server and PHP language are already on your machine.

To do so, feel free to use your favourite text editor such as <code>nano</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>subl</code> or my beloved <code>code</code>. Superuser privileges (<code>sudo</code>) will be needed.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-04-29-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Apache httpd configuration file\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"973\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>This is the main Apache configuration file that contains tons of helpful comments about all the available directives.

To enable it uncomment <code>LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so</code> and <code>Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</code> inside your Apache configuration file.</p>\n<pre><code>old: #LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so\nnew: LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so\n</code></pre><pre><code>old: #Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\nnew: Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"enable-rewrites\">Enable rewrites <a href=\"#enable-rewrites\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>By default <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html\">mod_rewrite</a> follows the filesystem path. For example the URL to a page about your company may end up being <code>mycompany.com/about.php</code>. In the case of WordPress we will more likely see something like <code>mycompany.com/?p=1</code>. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to simplify it to <code>mycompany.com/about</code>? This is the reason why we need to explicitly enable it.

We have to configure that in a way that our <code>localhost</code> serves files from <code>~/Sites</code> and <code>wp.localhost</code> from <code>~/Sites/wp.localhost</code>.

Feel free to comment it out or delete it. Add a configuration blocks that look like this (make sure that you have amended the paths accordingly to your username and domain):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-apache\" data-lang=\"apache\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;VirtualHost</span> <span class=\"s\">*:80</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">DocumentRoot</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/Users/pawelgrzybek/Sites&#34;</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">ServerName</span> localhost\n    <span class=\"nb\">ErrorLog</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/var/log/apache2/localhost-error_log&#34;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;VirtualHost</span> <span class=\"s\">*:80</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">DocumentRoot</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/Users/pawelgrzybek/Sites/wp.localhost&#34;</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">ServerName</span> wp.localhost\n    <span class=\"nb\">ErrorLog</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/var/log/apache2/wp.localhost-error_log&#34;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>The <code>DocumentRoot</code> tells Apache which directory the domain specified under the <code>ServerName</code> should be pointing to.

Please bare in mind that every single change of the Apache configuration files require rebooting of the server.

If you get <code>Syntax OK</code> feel free to run the server using <code>sudo apachectl start</code>.</p>\n<p>Test time! Now let&rsquo;s create a test <code>index.php</code> file in the <code>~/Sites</code> as we specified in vhost config file. Put a <code>&lt;?php phpinfo();</code> in there please.

If you are not a Homebrew user, please follow the installation steps from the website and take my word that it is going to make your life much easier in the future.

I never do a full backup of my machine though. I can download an operating system in few minutes, restore my system preferences via a <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles\">single click</a>, install all my frequently used apps using a <a href=\"https://caskroom.github.io/\">single command</a>, pull all of my projects from <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a> and listen to music on my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200\">Technics SL-1200</a> or stream it from Apple Music. The only thing that I keep backed up is my photo collection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-backup-strategy-in-a-nutshell\">My backup strategy in a nutshell <a href=\"#my-backup-strategy-in-a-nutshell\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Since May 2007 I have kept all of my photos in a well organized collection, ordered chronologically by year and by session / event. I keep exactly the same habit for all of my pictures taken on my iPhone in parallel. It is not an enormous amount of data (around 200GB) but the sentimental value that it holds is immense.</p>\n<p>No matter what, I always store this collection on two physical devices. It can be my computer&rsquo;s hard drive, an external flash disc, NAS server or a RAID array. Currently I use two totally average external <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Portable-External-Creative-Photography/dp/B00FP50LH2\">hard drives by Segate</a>. I am the happy owner of a superb <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3\">Sony Œ±7R III</a> that shoots 80 megabyte ARW files. Taking that into consideration I&rsquo;ve realised that I may run out of storage on these hard drives very quickly, but for now they do the job.</p>\n<p>However, things happen! Disks fail, people rob, rivers flood, comets fall. In case any of that occurs I need one more copy in the cloud. I have tested multiple solutions and services over the past few years and finally I feel that I have found something that is going to stick around. Although making a backup to a local hard drive is fairly easy and straight forward, cloud backups are way more complicated. Luckily I am here to help you out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-consider-to-be-a-good-cloud-backup-and-things-that-i-dont-care-about\">What I consider to be a good cloud backup and things that I don&rsquo;t care about <a href=\"#what-i-consider-to-be-a-good-cloud-backup-and-things-that-i-dont-care-about\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are plenty of services that offer cloud storage for amateur and professional photographers. <a href=\"https://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.box.com/\">Box</a>, <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/\">OneDrive</a>, <a href=\"https://home.zoolz.co.uk/\">Zoolz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/\">Backblaze</a> just to name a few.</p>\n<p>There are a few key things that I need to get out of my cloud backup solution. Security first ‚Äî I really don&rsquo;t want anyone to look at the pictures of my beautiful girlfriend. There is a reasonable chance that my collection will grow over time so auto-scaling and unlimited storage resources is another must-have. New services show up and vanish often and I am really not interested in investing my time in solutions that may not be around tomorrow. Do you remember <a href=\"https://copy.com/\">copy</a>? Quite a cool service but it didn&rsquo;t stay around for long though. Also price is an obvious factor of course.</p>\n<p>The providers listed above usually offer tons of things that I simply don&rsquo;t care about. I don&rsquo;t need a fancy app with tons of bells and whistles. I don&rsquo;t need a constant live sync and seamless integration with my OS. It is a last resort backup ‚Äî the file structure is probably never going to change. I will just add more stuff over time.</p>\n<p>I am here today not to compare the available options or convince you to use one over the other. I spent years looking for a solution that suits my needs and I would like to share it with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"say-hello-to-aws-simple-storage-service-s3\">Say hello to AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) <a href=\"#say-hello-to-aws-simple-storage-service-s3\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a> is a platform that offers a number of things that your business or you, as an individual, may need. From computational power, through to database storage, content delivery networks to machine learning and IoT (Internet of things) related products. A storage solution is one of the many services that AWS has to offer. It is well established and proven by the mile-long <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/all/\">list of clients</a> like: Adobe, AirBnb, Netflix, NASA, SoundCloud, Canon, GoPro‚Ä¶ The list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>You may have heard the opinion that AWS is complicated to use. In reality it is crazy complicated but to be in a band you don&rsquo;t have to play all the instruments ‚Äî just master a single one. Storage is what we need.</p>\n<p>AWS has a number of storage solutions in its product list. From simple solutions like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/\">AWS Snowmobile</a> ‚Äî a 45-foot long shipping container pulled by a truck to transfer extremely large amounts of data (up to 100PB). The thing that we need is a container of data stored within an S3 bucket and its seamless transition to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\">Glacier</a> class using lifecycle policies. Let me explain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-s3-and-how-it-works\">What is S3 and how it works <a href=\"#what-is-s3-and-how-it-works\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Amazon S3 is a simple storage solution that offers a range of classes designed for specific use cases. For frequently used, general storage use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#General_Purpose\">S3 Standard</a>. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Infrequent_Access\">Infrequent Access</a> works best for files that you don&rsquo;t have to access very often but still keep them accessible whenever you need them. For archiving purposes, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Archive\">Glacier</a> is the best option. Each of these categories comes with pros and cons and each of them suits different needs. The main differences between them are <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\">price</a> and waiting time to access objects (photos in our case). For those that are curious I would direct you to Marc Trimuschats presentation from the AWS Summit 2017. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bfDpK45Faa0\">Deep Dive on Object Storage</a> tells you everything that you need.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-02-27-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Amazon S3 storage classes\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"781\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Essentially, files stored in the hot storage (S3 Standard) are accessible immediately but they will cost you a fortune ($0.023 / GB). Cold storage (Glacier) on the other hand is extremely cheap ($0.004 per GB) but a file restoration can take from 1 minute up to 12 hours. You will be charged for each GB retrieved from the cold storage cluster too. The pricing may vary a bit depending on the region of your S3 &ldquo;bucket&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Privacy of files is something that we can easily control with S3. If you want to make a file public or private, no more than a single click is needed. Lifecycle policies help us to create a set of rules that invisibly migrate files between storage classes. I utilised the power of this feature to migrate all the files imported to the Standard bucket to Glacier the next day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to\">How to <a href=\"#how-to\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I mentioned before that AWS is complicated to use, but I hope that this step by step guide can make things easier for you. The S3 Storage may actually be one of the easiest to use services from the humongous number of products in AWS portfolio.</p>\n<p>Start with <a href=\"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup\">creating a free AWS account</a>. This process requires you to add a credit card to your account and authorise it by a phone call you will receive from Amazon&rsquo;s bot. It is worth mentioning that you are eligible to use a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/\">Free Tier</a> that gives you access to a snippet of AWS features totally for free. You can end this process here but I would strongly suggest to look at the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM (Identity and Access Management) best practices</a>. Personally I use my &ldquo;root&rdquo; account just for billing purposes and to manage users. For using AWS services I created a IAM user with sufficient permissions for my everyday tasks ‚Äî security first. Read more about the recommended way of using the AWS platform on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management Documentation</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Eh1uxLyXJ8\">Getting Started with Amazon Web Services</a> webinar is another helpful resource start with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our account is ready to use and now secure, it is time to create the first storage &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; under the S3 section. Use a unique name for your bucket and choose a location of interest. Make a wise decision at this point because you won&rsquo;t be able to change those details later on. Hit the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button and we are almost set up.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-02-27-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Create Amazon S3 bucket\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1250\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>In theory we are ready to use the service now but there is one thing that may help to automate our workflow a lot. We definitely don&rsquo;t want to change the storage class (Standard, IA and Glacier) for every file manually. As mentioned before lifecycle policies can automate the process for us. My aim is to migrate all the files that I put into my Standard S3 bucket as soon as possible to cheap cold storage (Glacier). To set it up that way, click on the name of the bucket created in the previous step and navigate to Lifecycle rules under the Management tab. Click the &ldquo;Add lifecycle rule&rdquo; button to define a new rule. Add a meaningful name to your rule and navigate further to the Transitions section. For the current version of your files create a rule that moves the file to Glacier after one day. We don&rsquo;t need to tweak settings for the previous versions because we didn&rsquo;t enable file versioning in the first place (you don&rsquo;t need that for backups). Click next to the Expiration tab just to keep it as it is (we really don&rsquo;t want our files to be removed) and proceed to the next tab ‚Äî Review. Make sure that you are happy with all the settings in the last step and save the rule. We are done!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-02-27-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Create Amazon S3 lifecycle policy\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"2776\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"gui-or-not\">GUI or not <a href=\"#gui-or-not\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Although the S3 web interface is very user friendly and fast, you may be interested in using a GUI (graphical user interface) tool to send files to your bucket. Luckily there are a lot of tools out there that let you access your Simple Storage Service easily. As a macOS user my personal preference is <a href=\"https://binarynights.com/\">ForkLift 3</a>. <a href=\"https://panic.com/transmit/\">Transmit 5</a> is another app for the Apple system that has garnered a great reputation. Maybe <a href=\"https://cyberduck.io/\">Cyberduck</a>? <a href=\"https://filezillapro.com/ftp/mac/\">FileZilla Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://s3browser.com/\">S3 Browser</a> could be good options for Windows users. Play around with the available options and let me know about your preferred way to interact with S3 objects.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2018-02-27-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Using Forklift 3 with Amazon S3\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1376\"\n  height=\"818\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"happy-backing-up\">Happy backing up <a href=\"#happy-backing-up\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I am very happy with this solution and it works for me really well.

I have done it many times simply because I&rsquo;ve had no other choice. There is an issue though ‚Äî <code>scroll</code> and <code>resize</code> events are performance bottlenecks. Nowadays, the <code>scroll</code> event can be replaced with the <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/the-intersection-observer-api-explained/\">Intersection Observer that I explained</a> before.

The number of unique visitors to this website went totally crazy. I&rsquo;m really happy about some of the discussions that took place beneath some of my articles. It motivates me to keep writing good stuff for my readers. Thank you all.</p>\n<p>However there is no rose without a thorn ‚Äî I had a few professional downfalls too. I experienced my first burnout and a strong experience of &lsquo;imposter syndrome&rsquo;. It happened in parallel with some big personal changes.

Exactly a year ago when I visited my parents over Christmas I was 10 kilograms (1.6 stone) heavier than I currently am. This is a huge difference. Physically I feel much better than ever before. I&rsquo;m able to run a decent distance and cycle like never before. The <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq\">Keto diet</a> is not the best fit for all obese people, but I&rsquo;m extremely glad that I managed to apply its rules to my daily routine and even start enjoying it.</p>\n<p>Another big realisation ‚Äî my hidden passion for photography is slowly coming out of the shadows and I&rsquo;m really pumped about taking more and more cool looking photos. Recently I invested in a really great <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3\">Sony A7R III</a> and a couple of still lenses (<a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/camera-lenses/sel85f14gm\">85mm 1.4 G</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/camera-lenses/sel35f28z\">35mm 2.8</a> by Carl Zeiss). Photography is one of the most relaxing pursuits for my brain. I&rsquo;m really glad that I&rsquo;ve found it again.</p>\n<p>There was another incredibly big personal accomplishment this year ‚Äî balance. I found a balance between my professional and my personal life. Balance between the things that I need and the things that would be nice to have. Balance between fast food and healthy quality food. Balance between having a crazy party and time spent with my girlfriend and best friends and a bottle of wine. It sounds trivial but actually it has made a big difference to my professional and personal sides.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-12-30-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"My best friends\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1200\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-2018-i-will\">In 2018 I will‚Ä¶ <a href=\"#in-2018-i-will\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This post would be a bit lacking without some commitment to the goals that I&rsquo;m planning for next year.

You can think of it as the equivalent of Gutenberg&rsquo;s press for graphics. Fragment shaders give you total control over the pixels rendered on the screen at a super fast speed. This is why they&rsquo;re used in all sort of cases, from video filters on cellphones to incredible 3D video games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-visual-studio-live-share\">Introducing Visual Studio Live Share <a href=\"#introducing-visual-studio-live-share\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share\">https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share</a></p>\n<p>A collaborative working in a real time is something that lots of digital tools implemented recently.

I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this path nowadays. Just download <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/\">Visual Studio Community</a>, switch default Unity IDE and enjoy very smooth integration.</p>\n\n<p>First things first ‚Äî I&rsquo;m not an experienced game developer. I just started my journey with Unity not long time ago and this article is a result of my early explorations that can be useful for newcomers.</p>\n<p>As a day to day front end developer I spend majority of the time in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Jumping from one territory to a completely new environment is a fantastic experience but comes with lots of difficulties. My biggest issue on early Unity expedition wasn&rsquo;t a C#, it wasn&rsquo;t a convoluted interface, nor a crazy amount of 3D vector math. It was a MonoDevelop ‚Äî the default IDE that Unity comes with and works smoothly out of the box. Lack of my favorite shortcuts, snippets system and absence of core functionalities that I use hundreds times a day. Visual Studio Code served me well for last few months and I couldn&rsquo;t stand writing a single line of code without it. After a while it turned up that VSCode can be linked with Unity to take an advantage of all the things that it is best at. Let&rsquo;s go through the whole process step by step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visual-studio-code-and-c-extension\">Visual Studio Code and C# extension <a href=\"#visual-studio-code-and-c-extension\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You can download <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VSCode from Microsoft website</a> for free. Installation process is very straight forward. Out of the box it doesn&rsquo;t support a language used by Unity ‚Äî it can be easily solved by installing <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp\">C# extension</a> from official marketplace.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-11-27-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visual Studio Code and C# extension\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1214\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>In the theory Unity works with three scripting languages ‚Äî C#, JavaScript and Python-like Boo. <a href=\"https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/09/03/documentation-unity-scripting-languages-and-you/\">Ditching Boo</a> has been announced long time ago and the same thing has been recently revealed about <a href=\"https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/11/unityscripts-long-ride-off-into-the-sunset/\">the future of Javascript-like UnityScript</a>. C# is the future of this platform ‚Äî much nicer ecosystem, tooling support and the bright future full of powerful features that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in the other language. If you have never worked with C# you don&rsquo;t have to worry ‚Äî <a href=\"https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/scripting\">official documentation</a> is a fantastic place to get you running.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unity-and-its-external-script-editor\">Unity and it&rsquo;s external script editor <a href=\"#unity-and-its-external-script-editor\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Despite the time that it takes to download, Unity set up isn&rsquo;t scary. I just would like to point your attention to the step where you can choose addition components that are going to be added during the installation process. As we are aiming to use it with Visual Studio Code, you can un-check MonoDevelop from the list of add-ons.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-11-27-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Unity comes with MonoDevelop\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1424\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Now you can go to the Unity settings and change your &ldquo;External Script Editor&rdquo; to Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-11-27-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visual Studio code as a external script editor for Unity\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1068\"\n  height=\"900\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"install-net-skd\">Install .NET SKD <a href=\"#install-net-skd\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Command Line Interface for the .NET Software Development Kit is something that we need. Download the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/macos\">latest version of the installer</a> from Microsoft website and follow the installation guide.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-11-27-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\".NET SDK installation screen\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1464\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"brew-and-mono\">Brew and Mono <a href=\"#brew-and-mono\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Mono is the last ingredient that we need to install to have a smooth integration with VSCode <a href=\"http://www.omnisharp.net/\">OmniSharp</a>. The easiest way is to download it from Homebrew. If you don&rsquo;t have it installed on your machine, you live your life wrong! <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Visit a website</a> to the missing package manager for macOS and follow the installation guide. Now the only thing that you need to run is‚Ä¶</p>\n<pre><code>brew install mono\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"vscode--unity--3\">VSCode + Unity = &lt;3 <a href=\"#vscode--unity--3\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There seem to be a lot of steps but actual the whole setup takes just a few minutes. You can now enjoy smooth integration of Unity and your favourite code editor.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-11-27-5.gif\"\n  alt=\"Unity integration into Visual Studio Code\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"800\"\n  height=\"600\"\n/>\n</p>"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2017 October","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2017-october/","pubDate":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2017-october/","description":"<h2 id=\"microsoft-edge-for-ios-and-android-what-developers-need-to-know\">Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android: What developers need to know <a href=\"#microsoft-edge-for-ios-and-android-what-developers-need-to-know\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/05/microsoft-edge-ios-android-developer/#3ZUtLS8GXDAl1RbT.97\">https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/05/microsoft-edge-ios-android-developer/#3ZUtLS8GXDAl1RbT.97</a></p>\n<p>And it is confirmed ‚Äî Microsofts browser is coming to Android and iOS devices.

Today this one is changing the game (hopefully). Studio ‚Äî design tool with the whole power of prototyping functionality baked in.

The instance (subject) maintains a collection of objects (observers) and notifies them all when changes to the state occurs. Does that sound difficult to you? Yes, it was upsetting me as well when I came across this pattern for a first time. A tiny practical example may help you to grasp the concept.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you have to update multiple elements simultaneously when some event occurs (typing inside the <code>input</code> field perhaps). You need to be able to add more (subscribe) elements that react (observe) to a change of an input value. Removing subscriptions (unsubscribe) can be handy if you no longer need to broadcast state changes to a particular object. Do you get the idea now? Let&rsquo;s code it!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"c1\">// define a class\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span

If you are a performance freak ‚Äî <a href=\"https://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-importnode/6\">jsPerf</a> shows a slightly faster computation for <code>importNode()</code>.

It creates something commonly known as a shallow copy. We can manually reattach all event listeners to the cloned node but that sounds like a tedious task. Back in the day we could find something like <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20010823/events.html#Events-EventListenerList\"><code>EventListenerList()</code></a> in the DOM spec. That would be very helpful in solving our issue but unfortunately it has been removed from the specification and the implementation isn&rsquo;t available on any browser. The reason for ditching this part of the spec can be found on multiple <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/7814692/2290040\">W3C mailing conversations</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] what is the motivation for adding this functionality at all? Previously, the working group resolved to remove the related but less powerful hasEventListenerNS method for lack of a use case, and because there are potential security issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be tricked by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/command-line-reference#geteventlistenersobject\"><code>getEventListeners()</code></a> either as this is only a part of the Chrome Command Line API and is available only from the Google browser&rsquo;s console. You cannot use it in your scripts.</p>\n<p>Because the native method for checking the events attached to an element doesn&rsquo;t exist we need to find a different solution. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the available options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inline-events\">Inline events <a href=\"#inline-events\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A little bit old-school but it will do in some circumstances. HTML elements allow us to add an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers\">event attribute</a> with a tiny bit of JavaScript functionality inside it. Like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">onclick</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;alert(&#39;Hello&#39;)&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>some element<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">onclick</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;clickHandler()&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>some element<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Although it is not very elegant, not pleasant to maintain and can cause some accessibility difficulties sometimes it can be the best way to go.

I had a quick glance at the cover art that boldly stated &ldquo;Make magic with CSS&rdquo;. Pfff ‚Äî I totally ignored it ‚Äî I know everything about CSS, don&rsquo;t I? It was a really nice espresso.</p>\n<p>It is an ordinary Sunday morning, I&rsquo;m enjoying my morning espresso shot on my sofa ‚Äî time for some press. After reading the first three paragraphs of &ldquo;Make magic with CSS&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aganaplocha\">Aga Naplocha</a> I&rsquo;ve realised that I had really fallen behind on my CSS skills. It is a really nice espresso but I&rsquo;m going to brew more because today is the day to catch up on some CSS magic ‚Äî blend modes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blend-modes-essentials\">Blend modes essentials <a href=\"#blend-modes-essentials\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you have ever used any image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Photo or Sketch App you probably have some experience with blend modes. Yes ‚Äî it is one of those features that designers love as it&rsquo;s essentially a shortcut method for doing beautiful things but front-end developers hate them because they are laborious to implement. A-ha! Not anymore! I will show you how in a second but first let&rsquo;s brush up on some theory courtesy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blend modes in digital image editing are used to determine how two layers are blended into each other. However, as each pixel has a numerical representation, a large number of ways to blend two layers is possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend modes in Adobe Photoshop, Sketch App and Affinity Photo\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"906\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>For lots of designers and developers working with blend modes is a very experimental process. Memorising all the mathematical calculations isn&rsquo;t required to use them effectively. It doesn&rsquo;t take much time to juggle with some options in Photoshop but it can be very time consuming when the same needs to be done in CSS or JavaScript. A little bit of understanding helps and I will do my best to help you with that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blend-modes-by-group\">Blend modes by group <a href=\"#blend-modes-by-group\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Photoshop and Sketch separate blending options into a few meaningful groups. Unfortunately Affinity Photo presents its options in a non-grouped manner (this would be worth adding in a future version). I&rsquo;m not going to describe the algorithm behind each of them as there are plenty of <a href=\"https://photoshoptrainingchannel.com/blending-modes-explained/\">detailed explanations</a> out there ‚Äî a brief summary of each group is enough to grasp the concept.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Grouped blend modes in Sketch App\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"806\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"normal\">Normal <a href=\"#normal\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>No mathematical algorithm is applied. If you are wondering why the very random looking &ldquo;Dissolve&rdquo; mode belongs to this group, you&rsquo;ve just answered your own question ‚Äî <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes#Dissolve\">random</a>. The example below shows the &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Normal group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"darken\">Darken <a href=\"#darken\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>As the name suggests ‚Äî the result will be darker than the initial look of the blended layer. The base colour is pure white. Every pixel darker than white results in a darkened output of blended pixels. Using this mode with pure white layers won&rsquo;t generate any effect. Darken generates inverted effects to modes from the &ldquo;Lighten&rdquo; category. The example below shows the &ldquo;Darken&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Darken group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"lighten\">Lighten <a href=\"#lighten\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>As the name suggests ‚Äî the result will be lighter than the initial look of the blended layer. The base colour is a pure black. Every pixel brighter than black results in a lightened output of blended pixels. Using this mode with pure black layers won&rsquo;t generate any effect. Lighten generates inverted effects to modes from the &ldquo;Darken&rdquo; category. The example below shows the &ldquo;Lighten&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Lighten group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"contrast\">Contrast <a href=\"#contrast\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Darken blend modes use pure white as the neutral point. Lighten ones use pure black. The Contrast group uses 50% gray as the base colour to recalculate the blended result. The purpose of this category is to manipulate the contrast of an image. The example below shows the &ldquo;Hard Light&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-6.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Contrast group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"inversion\">Inversion <a href=\"#inversion\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>This set of blend modes calculate the difference or colour inversion between two layers. This produces results where colours are cancelled or inverted in the colour wheel. The example below shows the &ldquo;Difference&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-7.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Inversion group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"component\">Component <a href=\"#component\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>The Component group allows us to blend primary colour components: hue, saturation and brightness. The example below shows the &ldquo;Hue&rdquo; blend mode.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-28-8.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Blend mode - Component group\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"800\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"software-vs-web-reality\">Software vs. web reality <a href=\"#software-vs-web-reality\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Web design software is much more generous with the available options than the web platform is. Adobe Photoshop gives us access to 27 blend modes, Sketch gives us 16 options and Affinity Photo offers a crazy 30 variations.</p>\n<p>According to the recent <a href=\"https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/\">Compositing and Blending Level Spec</a>, CSS comes with 16 values that we can use in our projects. These are exactly the same values as are available in Sketch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-css-blend-modes\">Working with CSS blend modes <a href=\"#working-with-css-blend-modes\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Enough theory ‚Äî time for some practice. As mentioned a second ago, CSS allows us to use the following values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-normal\"><code>normal</code></a> (initial value)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-multiply\"><code>multiply</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-screen\"><code>screen</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-overlay\"><code>overlay</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-darken\"><code>darken</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-lighten\"><code>lighten</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-color-dodge\"><code>color-dodge</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-color-burn\"><code>color-burn</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-hard-light\"><code>hard-light</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-soft-light\"><code>soft-light</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-difference\"><code>difference</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-exclusion\"><code>exclusion</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-hue\"><code>hue</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-saturation\"><code>saturation</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-color\"><code>color</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#valdef-blend-mode-luminosity\"><code>luminosity</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two CSS properties out there that allow us to work with blend modes: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#propdef-background-blend-mode\"><code>background-blend-mode</code></a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#mix-blend-mode\"><code>mix-blend-mode</code></a>. The effect that those properties produce is identical but the use case for them is different. Let&rsquo;s have a quick look at both of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"background-blend-mode\">background-blend-mode <a href=\"#background-blend-mode\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As it says on the tin <code>background-blend-mode</code> applies a blend mode to <code>background-color</code> or <code>background-image</code>. It can take multiple values when we use more than one background. Using it with gradients can produce really impressive results ‚Äî but I will leave the creativity to you. Let&rsquo;s have a look at a simple example.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">box</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">background-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#D3545B</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">background-image</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">url</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;image.jpg&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">background-blend-mode</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">multiply</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"mix-blend-mode\">mix-blend-mode <a href=\"#mix-blend-mode\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It would be a bit restrictive to use blend modes with backgrounds only. That&rsquo;s the reason why <code>mix-blend-mode</code> exists. It allows us to blend any element with its backdrop.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">page</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">background-image</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">url</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;image.jpg&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">box</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">background-image</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">repeating-linear-gradient</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"mi\">45</span><span class=\"kt\">deg</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"mh\">#D3545B</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"mh\">#D3545B</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kc\">transparent</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kc\">transparent</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">mix-blend-mode</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">darken</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>A word of advice! There is a bug in Chrome. Blending with the <code>body</code> element is broken in Google&rsquo;s browser ‚Äî it works like a charm in other ones though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-internet-explorer-edge-and-safari\">But Internet Explorer, Edge and Safari&hellip; <a href=\"#but-internet-explorer-edge-and-safari\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest ‚Äî the browser support isn&rsquo;t fantastic. Internet Explorer and Edge don&rsquo;t support it at all.

The good news is native <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-custom-properties-explained/\">custom properties</a> are much more powerful than statically declared ones from Sass. Mixins are amazing ‚Äî unfortunately the <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-mixins-with-apply-rule/\"><code>@apply</code> rule</a> has been <a href=\"http://www.xanthir.com/b4o00\">abandoned by the spec creator</a> but I&rsquo;m sure we will get some decent replacement at some point. <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/blink#vendor-prefixes\">The vendor prefixes imbroglio</a> is over and will never come back.

We were able to use modern features that browsers didn&rsquo;t support at the time. Things have changed though. Nowadays, browsers have really <a href=\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\">strong support</a> for present-day ingredients. Have a look at your Gulp build task or Webpack config ‚Äî there&rsquo;s a good chance that you don&rsquo;t need to transpile your code anymore.

For years web developers managed to find a number of ways to implement it: splitting the codebase into separated files and scopes, using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition\">AMD (Asynchronous module definition)</a> with file loaders like <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a> or making the Node-style <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS\">CommonJS</a> work in the browser via libraries like <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a>.</p>\n<p>Finalised in June 2015 the spec for the <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/\">6th edition</a> of JavaScript changed things a lot. One of the many amazing things that it brought was a native way of working with modules. It turned out that it was <a href=\"https://blog.whatwg.org/js-modules\">immensely hard</a> to implement on the web platform ‚Äî so module bundlers like <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> came into the game. They allowed us to write code in a modern way and spit out a bundled script understandable by the browser.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_10_1.html\">Safari 10.1</a> is the first browser that has received <a href=\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#safari10_1\">100% complete coverage for ECMAScript 2015 features</a>. Really great work Apple (<a href=\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/\">Service Workers</a> next please). It means that it is the first browser that allows us to use native modules. Another implementation landed on Google Chrome 61, Firefox 54 ‚Äì behind the <code>dom.moduleScripts.enabled</code> setting in <code>about:config</code> and Edge 16. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the nitty-gritty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-modules-in-the-browser\">Working with modules in the browser <a href=\"#working-with-modules-in-the-browser\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you have ever used <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> in your project, migrating this concept to a client won&rsquo;t be a challenging task. If you have never worked with these concepts before, give <a href=\"http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html\">this chapter</a> of Dr. Axel Rauschmayer&rsquo;s book a quick read.</p>\n<p>Nothing works better than a practical example. Let&rsquo;s create a script that prints a stylish log message into the console. Let&rsquo;s split it out into two files ‚Äî <code>index.js</code> as an entry point and <code>print.js</code> that holds a reusable print function (module).

Now let&rsquo;s forget about bundling for a sec and take advantage of a browser that can finally resolve all dependencies for us. This is how to do it baby‚Ä¶</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;./index.js&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;module&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Yes the essence lies here ‚Äî <code>type=&quot;module&quot;</code>. According <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-type-module-example-1\">to the spec</a> these few characters tell the browser that it can be used to include external module scripts. This is exactly what we need! Pay attention to the <code>import</code> path inside the <code>index.js</code> file ‚Äî it needs to be a concrete path to an imported file (including the extension). Let&rsquo;s open it in the browser (more about the support later on).</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-18-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Native ECMAScript modules in Safari\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1024\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>The browser managed to resolve the dependency of the <code>print.js</code> file. No Webpack magic here! Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-my-browser-doesnt-yes-it-does\">But my browser doesn&rsquo;t‚Ä¶ Yes it does! <a href=\"#but-my-browser-doesnt-yes-it-does\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A quick word about support of native modules across the browsers and some possible solutions. At the time of writing this article it&rsquo;s looking like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome Canary 61</li>\n<li>Firefox 54 ‚Äì behind the <code>dom.moduleScripts.enabled</code> setting in <code>about:config</code></li>\n<li>Edge 16</li>\n<li>Safari ‚Äî hell yeah!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-18-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Browser support for Native ECMAScript modules\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"940\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look very promising and is definitely not ready to use in production. There is a hope though! Let&rsquo;s have a look at what the console of any browser that lacks native module support shows when I open our pretty print example.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-18-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Native ECMAScript modules in Google Chrome\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1024\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>So what happened here? NOTHING! Absolutely nothing. Because Google Chrome doesn&rsquo;t support JavaScript modules it totally ignores it. You probably know where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;./index.js&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;module&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;./bundle.js&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">nomodule</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Yes! When modules are not supported natively let&rsquo;s use something that definitely works. As a fallback script let&rsquo;s use an output file from our module bundler of choice. It works perfectly well now in any browser that doesn&rsquo;t have a clue how to handle JavaScript modules. Make sure that you are not duplicating the same functionality for browsers that do support it ‚Äî it is exactly for this reason the <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#attr-script-nomodule\"><code>nomodule</code></a> attribute has been recently added to the spec. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the results in Safari and Google Chrome (or any other browser that doesn&rsquo;t support modules) now‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-04-18-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Native ECMAScript modules in Safari Technology Preview and Google Chrome\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"2767\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"last-word-about-javascript-modules\">Last word about JavaScript modules <a href=\"#last-word-about-javascript-modules\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>That&rsquo;s it. I hope that you are as equally excited about native modules as I am. I would like to leave you here with two conclusions.</p>\n<p>The last few years introduced many tools and added massive complexity to front-end development. The rapid change of the JavaScript workflow constantly attracts new developers and scares others. Module bundling is one of those things that adds gigantic confusion ‚Äî hopefully in this post I have demonstrated to you that it won&rsquo;t last forever. Things just became much simpler.</p>\n<p>The thing that I love about the web is its unpredictability and active transformation. One day, something becomes much simpler and the next day a new idea comes in to confuse our brains even more.

Newer feature that is coming to JavaScript spec is object spread operator that allows us to do it in even more redeable way (<code>{...obj1, ...obj2}</code>). Both of these methods come with one downside ‚Äî they generate shallow merge of top properties only.

All programming languages are just a layer of abstraction on top of this principle. This article isn&rsquo;t about this concept but there is a publication that I can highly recommend to those curious ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-How-Computers-Math/dp/0471732788\">&ldquo;The Definitive Guide to How Computers Do Math&rdquo;</a> by Clive Maxfield. The crucial outcome here is the fact that the computer doesn&rsquo;t care about the code readability ‚Äî we developers do however so the code should be written in a way to help humans to read it. I&rsquo;m almost sure that you heard before this popular sentence taken from from Martin Fowler&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672\">book</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Knowing this, imagine a program that is written like a sentence instead of a series of commands in terminated lines. Method chaining, also known as a &ldquo;fluent interface&rdquo;, is a design pattern that allows us to do just that. Today&rsquo;s example is written in JavaScript as that is the language I feel most comfortable with, but the same pattern can be used in many other programming languages too. As always, I&rsquo;m here to explain the practice ‚Äî the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface\">wiki page</a> contains a great definition and tons of great examples if you need it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is an implementation of an object oriented API that aims to provide more readable code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"create-an-element-add-some-content-and-color-append-to-another-node\">Create an element, add some content and color, append to another node&hellip; <a href=\"#create-an-element-add-some-content-and-color-append-to-another-node\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One of the best fluent interfaces out there is the good old friend of all front-end developers ‚Äî <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a>. The similarity of code written using it to sentences written in English is surely one of the reasons why it has gained such popularity.</p>\n<p>We are going to write a small script that creates a DOM element, manipulates its content, changes colour and allows us to append it to another node. It looks something like this&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kr\">class</span> <span class=\"nx\">myElement</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">constructor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">createElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nx\">addText</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">text</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nx\">addColor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">color</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">color</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">color</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nx\">addToElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">appendChild</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>To use it&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"c1\">// create a new empty paragraph\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">myParagraph</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">myElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// add text to the element\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">myParagraph</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addText</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;my super paragraph&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// add colour to the element\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">myParagraph</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addColor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// add element to the body\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nx\">myParagraph</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addToElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">body</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>There is nothing wrong about this code. The amount repetitive steps that we&rsquo;ve taken isn&rsquo;t needed though. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to just write:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">myParagraph</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">myElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addText</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;some test here&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addColor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addToElement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">body</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>It looks much better, cleaner and we&rsquo;re not repeating ourselves. Unfortunately it is not going to work because the methods don&rsquo;t return a value at the moment. Luckily the solution is very simple ‚Äî¬†each method execution should not only edit an element but should also return a reference to the <code>myElement</code> instance via the <code>this</code> keyword.

You definitely won&rsquo;t find any gluten-free vegan cake recipes here, but there is a good chance that I can share with you a few words about some software or hardware. I <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/\">did it before</a> about two years ago so I think it&rsquo;s just about the right time to wrtie an update. Some things have changed, some things have been replaced but overall everything has been simplified and minimised. I always enjoy these kind of reads so I thought you may like to find out more about my equipment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#hardware\">Hardware</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#software\">Software</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#web-services\">Web Services</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"hardware\">Hardware <a href=\"#hardware\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Mattias P Johansson, one of my favourite developers that I highly recommend you to follow on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpjme\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q\">Youtube</a>, made a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hlYiWznhhzw\">whole video</a> about minimalism. Let me quote my favourite part‚Ä¶</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything that you acquire, carries a little bit of tiny work that you have to do with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few years ago I was focused on owning things: the latest devices, top spec computers, expensive cameras etc. It took me a while to realise that I&rsquo;m much happier without it. Reducing the maintenance cost and time that I had to spend with all those things gave me that extra bit of time that I can use to do other things like riding my bike, listening good music or hanging out with my friends. Following this principle my hardware setup hasn&rsquo;t grow at all ‚Äî the opposite in fact. Essentially I don&rsquo;t have (and don&rsquo;t want to have) things that I don&rsquo;t need. Let&rsquo;s check what&rsquo;s inside my bag.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-02-25-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Bose QC 35 &#43; Macbook Pro 2015\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1072\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"macbook-pro-with-retina-display-early-2015\">Macbook Pro with Retina display (Early 2015) <a href=\"#macbook-pro-with-retina-display-early-2015\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It is a top spec MacBook Pro with a 13 inch screen from early 2015 (3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 and 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage). Of course when I saw a <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/\">new MacBook Pro</a> with a Touch Bar I was tempted for a little while but‚Ä¶ I really like my actual Esc button, I don&rsquo;t need more powerful components and definitely don&rsquo;t want to spend ¬£2500 on something that I don&rsquo;t need (yet). I have an Apple care with extended warranty plan till mid 2018 ‚Äî the sexy body on each new MacBook won&rsquo;t convince me to throw a small fortune in Tim Cook&rsquo;s pocket any earlier than that. Overall I&rsquo;m very happy with this computer - I don&rsquo;t even use the power that its inner-components have. It has a solid day&rsquo;s battery life, is portable enough to always keep in my rucksack, it still looks sexy and works great with my other devices ‚Äî it&rsquo;s all I need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iphone-7-plus-32gb\">iPhone 7 Plus 32GB <a href=\"#iphone-7-plus-32gb\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I bought my first iPhone in 2010. Since then I haven&rsquo;t used devices from different manufacturers because this one just works. No surprises here - the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 Plus resides in my pocket. It is extremely stable, comfortable to use and it has one feature that makes me love this device ‚Äî the camera! Sometimes it is just hard to believe that something that small can produce such insanely good quality pictures. There&rsquo;s no rose without a thorn though. I&rsquo;m getting increasingly jealous about the really cool features that users of the latest Android smartphones have access to. <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/the-not-so-secret-powers-of-the-mobile-browser/\">The (Not So) Secret Powers Of The Mobile Browser</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/\">St√©phanie Walter</a> is a great article in Smashing Magazine that walks us through the cool modern features of mobile browsers. Cool, but even though I&rsquo;m ultra excited about it doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can try any of them so‚Ä¶ Apple, please ‚Äî catch up! We (developers) need Service Workers, we want to make progressive web apps, we want to play around with the payment or bluetooth interface as Googlers do. I won&rsquo;t use an Android device for convenience reasons only but I may buy one of those fancy Pixel XL&rsquo;s to mess around with VR and the other cool stuff that St√©phanie wrote about. Apple, please‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3 id=\"bose-qc35\">Bose QC35 <a href=\"#bose-qc35\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This year another cool gadget joined a list of things that I&rsquo;m not going out without in my bag. The <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless.html\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> wireless headphones is probably the best spent ¬£329.95 in my whole life. When I&rsquo;m coding or writing the importance of isolation from the outside world and being alone with my own thoughts is immensely important. I doubted the sound quality of wireless, non-physical connectivity before I got them. Things have changed and I won&rsquo;t go back to having a cable ‚Äî no chance. It has some occasional bluetooth connectivity quirks and the battery doesn&rsquo;t last forever but overall I&rsquo;m very happy and I can&rsquo;t imagine a single day of productive work without it. A lightweight construction, robust build and incredible sound quality is what I expected from a product in this price range and I&rsquo;m not disappointed at all. Do you want to test them before placing an order? Grab a beer and pop in my friend.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Software <a href=\"#software\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Following the same principle as the hardware, I use much less software on my devices. Compared to <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/\">the same list</a> that I made few years ago, some of the little toys have been replaced with more holistic productivity solutions, some stayed as they were and lots of stuff just disappeared. Let&rsquo;s check what&rsquo;s on my hard drive.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-02-25-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"My favorite software\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1072\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"google-chrome\">Google Chrome <a href=\"#google-chrome\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There must be a reason why this app has kept it&rsquo;s status of <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/\">the most popular web browser</a> for so many years. No surprises here ‚Äî Google Chrome is probably the most frequently used app on my computer. Even setting aside the seamless bookmarks, plugins and settings synchronization, this browser has one big advantage over it&rsquo;s competitors ‚Äî dev tools. The number of helpful panels for web developers is the main reason why I use it. A fantastic team of engineers who are constantly working hard to make it better surprise me every time they announce a new version. React Developer Tools, Vue.js devtools, uBlock Origin, Pinboard Tools, 1Password and JSON Formatter are the only extensions that I have added to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visual-studio-code\">Visual Studio Code <a href=\"#visual-studio-code\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As a huge fan and long term <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> user, creator of a few plugins and active supporter of it&rsquo;s development, switching to a different code editor would be the last thing I would have expected a little while ago. However, in the meantime Microsoft produced two things that front-end developers should know about: <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> and <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>. Typescript is fantastic, but do you know what I like even more? Yes, Visual Studio Code! Open-source, written entirely with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript wrapped into a multi-platform desktop app with Electron. It is lightweight, fast, beautiful and extremely powerful. Compared to ST where the learning curve and configuration means it takes some time to fully embrace it&rsquo;s potential, VSCode gives you a top-notch user experience out of the box. The community already loves using and improving it ‚Äî just have a look at any of the monthly updates and the change log is full of new features. The integrated command line saves me so much time instead of jumping back and forth between editor and iTerm. The integrated git client allows me to commit the progress of my work, fetch changes from my remote branch or push its current state in a fraction of a second. Built in IntelliSense it makes my life a whole lot easier ‚Äî method definitions, parameter info, auto-completion. When the IDE-ish look of it distracts me I can switch to the minimal Zen mode with a single shortcut. I can really wax lyrical about it but there is no point, just download it, use it and love it as I do. If you are looking for helpful tips for a smooth transition from Sublime Text to Microsoft&rsquo;s product, check a few of my recent articles about <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/sync-vscode-settings-and-snippets-via-dotfiles-on-github/\">config files</a> and <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/using-the-javascript-console-in-visual-studio-code/\">custom tasks</a>. You can be assured that I&rsquo;m going to be writing more about it here.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-02-25-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visual Studio Code\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1200\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-02-25-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Visual Studio Code Zen Mode\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1200\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"sketch--affinity-photo\">Sketch &amp; Affinity Photo <a href=\"#sketch--affinity-photo\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a designer and I don&rsquo;t use graphic applications as often as I use my code editor. I just need a reliable tool to make a simple logo for my tiny open source projects, quickly smash together a prototype for a client or crop an image of my cat to upload to Facebook. Sketch is probably the best UI design tool that I have ever worked with ‚Äî not a surprise as the <a href=\"https://avocode.com/design-report-2016/\">2016 Web Design Trend Report</a> clearly shows that Sketch is not a niche application anymore. I love the intuitive workflow, the performance, iCloud integration, resizing options that are not available in other tools and of course the plugins API that opens up a wide range of new features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/\">Affinity Photo</a> is my Photoshop replacement. Okay so maybe it isn&rsquo;t as powerful, it doesn&rsquo;t have video editing options (why would you need that in PHOTOshop anyway?!) and maybe there aren&rsquo;t as many Youtube tutorials as there are for Photoshop but it still does the job really well. A recent update to <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/new-features/\">version 1.5</a> brought the app a decent bunch of features that means this app genuinely competes with Adobe Photoshop. It&rsquo;s no suprise that this app won the <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/blog/affinity-photo-wins-best-imaging-software-award/\">Best Imaging Software Award in 2016</a>. I published <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/\">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t miss you Adobe&rdquo;</a> two years ago and nothing has really changed since.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alfred\">Alfred <a href=\"#alfred\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As a long term Alfred user I embraced it&rsquo;s true power only recently. On first glance it looks like the default Spotlight app but when you dig deeper it can be one of the best productivity friends in your life. It&rsquo;s power allowed me to delete so many little apps like <a href=\"https://copyless.net/\">CopyLess</a> and <a href=\"http://mizage.com/divvy/\">Divvy</a>. Apart from features like custom web search, a snippets manager and the multi clipboard it does one more thing that provides almost endless possibilities ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/\">workflows</a>. Recently I created a few workflows that were adopted really well in the community: <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/div-simple-alfred-windows-manager/\">Div ‚Äî a simple Alfred window manager</a>, <a href=\"http://www.packal.org/workflow/github-search\">Github Search</a> and a handy <a href=\"http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-npm-search\">npm search</a>. If you are one of those who like to automate repetitive tasks, this is the tool for you. The basic version is free of charge but the real power comes with <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/\">Powerpack</a> that costs the same as about three pints of beer.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-02-25-5.gif\"\n  alt=\"Alfred GitHub and npm search\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"800\"\n  height=\"600\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"tweetbot\">Tweetbot <a href=\"#tweetbot\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m addicted of Twitter ‚Äî I literally read every single tweet. The web client is getting better with every update, but in my opinion it is not the most convenient way to consume your feed. Tweetbot by <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/\">Tapbots</a> is an app that I found very useful by giving me features that I don&rsquo;t have from the official app. The <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/\">Desktop version</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/\">iOS one</a> is the perfect combination because it comes with a timeline sync ‚Äî  I never miss a single tweet. Mute filters are great for hiding football crap and Rihanna&rsquo;s videos from my feed. The easy shortcut to send items to &ldquo;read later&rdquo; makes it my app of choice and is something that I use a lot. On top of that, this app just looks beautiful. It&rsquo;s not cheap though ‚Äî wait for a sale that happens occasionally and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reeder\">Reeder <a href=\"#reeder\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve used this app since it first came out. I tested other RSS readers in the meantime but I haven&rsquo;t found one that is as good as my favourite <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> by Silvio Rizzi. It&rsquo;s beautiful, full of useful gestures that makes it feel as if it&rsquo;s one of the core mac OS / iOS apps, fast and reliable. If you are old-school like myself and still believe in power of RSS then give this one a try. In combination with a free Feedly account it serves me with fresh content everyday.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1password\">1password <a href=\"#1password\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Probably the first piece of software that I install on my devices whenever I get new one. It holds all of my passwords and private data under one single password or touch or my thumb on iOS. I know that many other password managers exist and I haven&rsquo;t tried them because this one suits my needs perfectly. The Google Chrome extension gives me access to all my super complicated passwords straight from window of my browser. It syncs really well between my devices via iCloud. If you are concerned about keeping encrypted data in the cloud you can always sync it via wifi and stay away from remote servers. The number of <a href=\"https://1password.com/love-from-customers/\">happy 1Password users</a> doesn&rsquo;t suprise me because I&rsquo;m one of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"things\">Things <a href=\"#things\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a productivity ninja but I use a kind of &ldquo;to do&rdquo; methodology because I easily forget about stuff. <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/\">Things</a> is really cool for this! If perfectly fits into GTD (get things done) methodology workflow, offers a dedicated cloud sync and looks beautiful on both iPhone and mac OS. Repetitive tasks, project management and events scheduling is something that sets it apart from default reminder apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"screenflow\">ScreenFlow <a href=\"#screenflow\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Do you record screen-casts? Do you need a basic video editing app? Animated gifs are cool, aren&rsquo;t they? This is the app for you. Every single video that I post on Twitter / Facebook, animated gif, screen-cast, &ldquo;how to do&rdquo; video for a client I record via <a href=\"http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/\">ScreenFlow</a>. It is not cheap but worth the money. The very intuitive interface requires almost no learning curve, it has great integration with all possible media formats, tons of shortcuts, configurations options, an amazing library of video tutorials and so many more cool things make it the best screen-cast app ever.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mail-app\">Mail App <a href=\"#mail-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I do receive emails mainly from Ebay, Amazon, PayPal, Discogs and occasionally from my mom. Default Mail App is everything that I need.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"web-services\">Web services <a href=\"#web-services\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The web is powerful enough to work as a great environment to handle powerful and useful web apps. There are plenty of great tools but I use only a few of them. I&rsquo;m not going to go through obvious things like mail providers or contacts / calendars sync services. Just specific tools for specific tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pinboard\">Pinboard <a href=\"#pinboard\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Some time ago I published a <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/bookmarking-with-pinboard/\">whole article</a> about <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a> created by Maciej Ceg≈Çowski. In my opinion this is the best place to bookmark links, opened browser tabs, tweets and articles to read later. The design isn&rsquo;t catchy, it costs a bit of money and it isn&rsquo;t the first bookmarking service that pops out on Google results but it comes with other benefits ‚Äî usability and performance. The great tagging system, handy browser extensions, and an advanced API that allows other apps to connect with it are my main reasons for using it and not looking elsewhere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feedly\">Feedly <a href=\"#feedly\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Yeah I know, RSS is dead, blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶ Nope! I love RSS and it is still my main source of web info. Since the early days of Google Reader I&rsquo;ve used this technology and it doesn&rsquo;t slow down. Nowadays I use Feedly to fetch feeds from my favourite websites. To consume them I use mentioned above Reeder. The free version is absolutely enough if you need just an aggregator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"codepen\">Codepen <a href=\"#codepen\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is one of the very few web services that I pay money for and I absolutely don&rsquo;t regret it. I use <a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">Codepen</a> every single day to smash some quick front-end experiment, to check possibilities of my stupid ideas and for‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3 id=\"crossbrowsertestingcom\">CrossBrowserTesting.com <a href=\"#crossbrowsertestingcom\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Cross browser testing! It was always a pain. Without paying for an expensive service like BrowserStack you are basically screwed. However, good news is coming! As I&rsquo;m a CodePen Pro user I have access to test all of my experiments with <a href=\"https://app.crossbrowsertesting.com/\">CrossBrowserTesting.com</a> totally for free. That&rsquo;s amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? Its helped me a lot to make a comprehensive tests of one of my recent libraries <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/\">Siema</a> and it serves me well every single day. It works like a charm, it is quick and gives me an access to hundreds of browsers across many operating systems. Love it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"apple-music\">Apple Music <a href=\"#apple-music\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>On the other side of my room I have around 500 or so vinyl records categorised into a few categories: polish jazz, polish rap, jazz, rap, funk, compilations, singles, 45s. I love music and I love it not only at home, but I love it when I work, when I run or when I cook. It would be difficult to grab a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200\">Technics SL-1200</a> for an evening run however. Apple Music is my service of choice. I don&rsquo;t want to go in depth why I chose this one over another one. I tried it, it works great, it doesn&rsquo;t cost fortune and doesn&rsquo;t require additional software apart from the one that already resides on my mac.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not everything that I use on a daily basis but I didn&rsquo;t want to write a mile-long article. Let me list few cool ones but not worth to spent a paragraph on them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Womens-Watches/Timex-Unisex-T2N746-Quartz-Analogue-Display-Multicolour/B0078QHI86/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487930930&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=timex+weekender\">Timex Weekender T2N746</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://static.evanscycles.com/production/bikes/road-bikes/product-image/969-638/subrosa-letum-fixed-2011-single-speed-bike-EV136031-9999-1.jpg\">Subrosa Letum 2011</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Victorinox-Spartan-Swiss-Army-Knife-x/dp/B0001P15CG/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487931219&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=Victorinox+pocket+knife\">Victorinox Spartan Swiss Army Knife</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://uk.hermes.com/perfumes/men/terre-d-hermes.html\">Terre d&rsquo;Herm√®s</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thenorthface.co.uk/shop/en-gb/tnf-gb/women%26-39%3Bs-vault-backpack-CHJ1?variationId=SRS\">North Face Vault Black</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Damn, this has turned out to be much longer than I initially planned.

Announced at the same time was a yearly release plan that aims to deliver a new version of the language annually and ship it with the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/README.md\">proposals</a> that are ready at the time of the TC39 meeting. The list of language improvements is open and you can track it on the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposals\">TC39 Github account</a>. You can find more info about the process itself <a href=\"https://tc39.github.io/process-document/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>A year ago I published a <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2016-es7/\">summary of new features from the 2016 spec</a>, and the list below presents the recently agreed proposals that will become part of ECMAScript this year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"async-functions\">Async functions <a href=\"#async-functions\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Chained callbacks should have been ditched a long time ago.

The new <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> and  pre-existing <code>TypedArray</code> and <code>DataView</code> types can be used to allocate shared memory. The new <code>Atomics</code> object allows you to carry out some operations using shared memory. Quoting the author of this proposal it should help developers to handle the following use cases&hellip;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Support for threaded code in programs written in other languages that are translated to asm.js or plain JS or a combination of the two, notably C and C++ but also other, safe, languages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Support for hand-written JS or JS+asm.js that makes use of multiprocessing facilities for select tasks, such as image processing, asset management, or game AI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md\">A brief tutorial</a> created by Lars T Hansen is a great explainer. <a href=\"http://2ality.com/2017/01/shared-array-buffer.html\">This article</a> by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer is a lengthy article that I highly encourage you to read if you would like to understand the background and dive deeper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"objectvalues-and-objectentries\">Object.values and Object.entries <a href=\"#objectvalues-and-objectentries\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need lodash or jQuery anymore to return enumerable pairs of entries or values from an object.

It&rsquo;s turned out to be one of the most popular articles on this website. As I recently changed my code editor from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VSCode</a> I found a solution to replicate this functionality.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html\">Build Systems</a> in Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code comes with <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks\">Tasks</a> that allows us to pass a file to an external program without manually switching between the code editor and the Terminal. This is essentially all that we need to do ‚Äî pass a currently active file to a JavaScript interpreter (<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node</a> in this case - so make sure it is installed on your computer).</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-javascript--node-task-in-vscode\">Create JavaScript / Node task in VSCode <a href=\"#create-javascript--node-task-in-vscode\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A VSCode Task is a set of instructions in a JSON file that resides in our projects file. Unfortunately at this moment it isn&rsquo;t possible to create globally available tasks ‚Äî they need to be added per project. The good news is that the development of VSCode is rapid so we may see global tasks appear very soon as <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1435\">I&rsquo;m not the only one</a> who wants this feature. To create a Task hit <code>cmd + shift + p</code> on Mac, <code>ctrl + shift + p</code> on Windows / Linux or simply <code>F1</code> on any platform to show the Command Palette, type &ldquo;Tasks: Configure Task&rdquo; then &ldquo;Create tasks.json file from template&rdquo; and choose &ldquo;Others&rdquo; from the list. Time to configure the task.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;version&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;2.0.0&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;tasks&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;label&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;Show in console&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;type&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;shell&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;osx&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">&#34;command&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/usr/local/bin/node ${file}&#34;</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;linux&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">&#34;command&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;/usr/bin/node ${file}&#34;</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;windows&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">&#34;command&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node.exe ${file}&#34;</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;group&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">&#34;kind&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;build&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">&#34;isDefault&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>OK, so what is going on here? When we run a task called &ldquo;Show in console&rdquo; this will run a shell command that takes our currently opened file as an argument preceded by the path to our node executable. To make things even easier the <code>group.kind</code> property lets us run this task via <code>shift + cmd + b</code> keyboard shortcut.</p>\n<p>In most cases the &ldquo;node&rdquo; in <code>command</code> property does the job instead of passing a full path. I found this method more reliable though. The path can vary depending on operating system, version and installation method. Update <code>command</code> according to the output of <code>which node</code>. On Windows the equivalent command is <code>where node</code>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-18-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Find path to node executable in Terminal\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"778\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Time for the fun bit!

As long as you are logged in to Google Chrome (or any other browser) the synchronization of settings and plugins happens in the background. Unfortunately syncing settings between applications like VSCode is not as straight forward. However, just because it doesn&rsquo;t come baked into the software it doesn&rsquo;t mean it is impossible.</p>\n<p>As a long term Sublime Text user I managed to use Github to sync its settings across multiple machines via <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles\">.dotfiles</a>. I used Atom for a little while and I found a way to mimic this mechanism for it as well. <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/sync-atom-between-multiple-devices/\">I published an article</a> about it the other day. Today it is time to show you how to do it with VSCode. By the way - <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VSCode</a> is awesome!</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-vscode-settings-to-dotfiles\">Moving VSCode settings to .dotfiles <a href=\"#moving-vscode-settings-to-dotfiles\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The folder in which your VSCode settings and snippets reside depends on the operating system. <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization/userandworkspace\">User and Workspace Settings</a> and its locations are described in the official documentation. As a macOS user I will provide some snippets associated with this operating system, but if you are a Windows or Linux user feel free to follow along and replace the paths accordingly. Before pasting anything into your Terminal make sure to shut down VSCode.</p>\n<p>OK, let&rsquo;s move the settings files and the directory containing your snippets to your .dotfiles that is located in the root folder.</p>\n<pre><code>mv ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/settings.json ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/\nmv ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/\nmv ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/snippets/ ~/.dotfiles/VSCode/\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"create-symbolic-links-to-vscode-settings-file-directory\">Create symbolic links to VSCode settings file directory <a href=\"#create-symbolic-links-to-vscode-settings-file-directory\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>All that we need is in the correct location now, time to create symlinks to those files.</p>\n<pre><code>ln -s /Users/pawelgrzybek/.dotfiles/VSCode/settings.json /Users/pawelgrzybek/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/settings.json\nln -s /Users/pawelgrzybek/.dotfiles/VSCode/keybindings.json /Users/pawelgrzybek/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json\nln -s /Users/pawelgrzybek/.dotfiles/VSCode/snippets/ /Users/pawelgrzybek/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User\n</code></pre><p>Boom! And it&rsquo;s done! Easy eh? Now you can commit the new &ldquo;Code&rdquo; directory to your .dotfiles repo, create symbolic links across all your machines and enjoy version controlled settings and snippets.</p>\n<p>If you have any idea how to sync the list of plugins installed from VS Code Marketplace please let me know in the comments.

It&rsquo;s always been a technical blog without delving into personal feelings and photos of my cat (ok maybe <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/image-tag-vs-background-property/\">once</a>). I&rsquo;m going to keep it this way but the article that you are reading now will be the only exception. The end of a year and beginning of a new one is a fantastic opportunity to summarise my achievements, failures and set up some goals for the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>This year was pretty wild personally. It&rsquo;s been full of tough incidents like my mother&rsquo;s cancer (she is fine now) that taught me a lot and made me look at life from a totally different perspective. Next year is going to be very important for me because from the 20th August 2017 I wont see a &ldquo;2&rdquo; in front of my age anymore. I&rsquo;m going to be 30 this year! Let me present my professional and personal achievements of the past year followed by my 2017 goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"professional\">Professional <a href=\"#professional\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Creare is the company where I worked for almost two years. It was an amazing time for me but in the middle of 2016 the management of the company changed and I made the snap decision to leave. It was time to find a better place where I could grow, fueled by my passion for the web. Literally on the same day I left the company, the guys from <a href=\"https://www.enginecreative.co.uk/\">Engine Creative</a> sent me an invitation for a Front-End Dev position. It is a company with an amazing reputation and it is not an easy thing to join a team of the most creative people in middle England. I did it and I&rsquo;m extremely proud to be a part of this great company. I learn a lot, I receive lots of inspiration from my co-workers, huge support from the directors and I feel that I can make an impact (that sounds so hipster). Thanks Engine!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-03-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Engine Creative Team\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1200\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>A developer&rsquo;s life doesn&rsquo;t stop at 5PM when I leave the office. It&rsquo;s been the best year for my open source contributions ever! I contributed over 800 times into a plethora of open source projects. The most successful of my open source projects is <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/\">Siema</a> - a simple carousel plugin written in pure JS with no dependencies. I did it totally for fun, but the community has adopted these few lines of code with great enthusiasm. Many thanks open source people!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-03-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"GitHub contribution graph in 2016\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"342\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>The website that you are looking at has grown insanely. Maybe not massively grown in content but it has gained increasingly high popularity. With around 80 unique daily visitors last year I&rsquo;m now talking about over 3000 unique visitors every single day. This is what I call a personal success! This year I wrote 30 articles and I consider this a huge achievement. Thanks for reading guys, this is the thing that will keep me publishing more and more in 2017.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-03-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Unique visitor on my website in December 2016\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"555\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal\">Personal <a href=\"#personal\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This year I realised that I have a problem. I totally lost the balance between the personal and professional parts of my life. Losing this balance cannot be considered a life success but acknowledging it can be a good starting point in doing something about it. More about this in the resolutions section below.</p>\n<p>For the first time in my life I have some savings. I managed to find a reasonable balance between the things that I need and the things that I want ‚Äî this is definitely helpful when you are facing your 30s.</p>\n<p>This year I took my first decent holiday in years and I understood the importance of time away from my computer. Thanks to my amazing friend Christina who invited me to spend a week with her in a small, beautiful village in Greece. I have to say that when I came back after that holiday my productivity was better than ever before. I&rsquo;m adding a decent holiday to the list of things that I&rsquo;m going to do regularly every year. Thanks again Christina :-*</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-03-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Beach in Pefkohori with Christina\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1199\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>In 2015 I didn&rsquo;t read a single non-technical book. Unfortunately I still cannot share with you any impressive statistics about the number of non-technical books that I read in 2016 but it is getting better. It is such a great feeling to read something that doesn&rsquo;t require every single cog in your brain to spin. I want to do it more often.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-2017-i-will\">In 2017 I will&hellip; <a href=\"#in-2017-i-will\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My main focus in 2017 is around finding a healthy balance between my personal and professional life. I want to enter my 30s in great mental condition and slightly better physical condition.</p>\n<p>Speaking about my professional self, 2017 is a year of new things! In 2017 I will learn a new programming language just for fun. It may be Elm, it may be Swift or my first steps with C - we will see. Another new skill that I&rsquo;m planning to learn is video making. I&rsquo;m not going to dedicate my whole life to it, but I feel the need to do something more in this area. As a huge fan of photography I&rsquo;m planning to invest some money in a new system of Sony cameras and get my hands dirty with video making.</p>\n<p>A few years ago I didn&rsquo;t know English at all, but since I met my other half and moved to the UK five years ago things have changed and my communication skills are getting better. Although it&rsquo;s still not perfect I&rsquo;m ready to accept a big challenge ‚Äî speak at my first conference ever. I have been invited to one reputable event and have accepted it! Crazy! I have submitted to do a few talks for other European conferences in 2017. Stay tuned and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pawelgrzybek\">follow me on Twitter</a> to find out more later on this year.</p>\n<p>I have now been together with my girlfriend for five years and for all the better (and despite some of the worst) moments we have decided to go one step further. This is too personal for me to share more details here. But, essentially, I&rsquo;ve grown up :)</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2017-01-03-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"My girlfriend Olga and myself\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1200\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>I wish you all an amazing 2017 guys.

Practically every other website at the moment belongs in one of those two categories. Crazy people!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already built a <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/do-you-really-need-another-grid-system/\">grid system</a> and today I would like to present you a new tool that I created. Yes, you guessed it - a carousel plugin! <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/\">Siema</a> is a very lightweight (just 1kb gzipped) tool written in pure JavaScript with no dependencies. It is well supported (IE10, Chrome 12, Firefox 16, opera 15, Safari 4, Android 4 and iOS 6) and the documentation is easy to digest for beginners. It is 100% open-source and <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema\">available on Github</a>. Use it totally for free on personal or commercial projects. It comes with a few options and an API that exposes a few useful methods. Detailed documentation and an installation video tutorial is available on <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/\">Siema&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-12-08-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Siema - Lightweight and simple carousel with no dependencies\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1000\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Bug fixes and feature suggestions are more than welcome. Siema&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a basic carousel tool and allow developers to extend it by using the available methods. It doesn&rsquo;t come with any complex configuration and myriad options ‚Äî I would like to keep it this way. If you need a more powerful library I recommend the amazing <a href=\"http://flickity.metafizzy.co/\">Flickity</a> by David DeSandro or <a href=\"http://idangero.us/swiper/\">Swiper</a> by iDangero team.</p>\n<p>Siema means &lsquo;hello&rsquo; in Polish.

It can be a mouse, touch pad or more precise tools like the pencil often used with an iPad Pro or other devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note. Touch devices are also reading events triggered by your fingers. But wait a sec ‚Äî it is 2016 ‚Äî pressure and tilt-aware devices exist and presumably you&rsquo;ve got one in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Essentially trying to fulfil a rich experience for all those scenarios is a mess. When is a <code>mouseleave</code> or <code>mouseout</code> event triggered? Does it bubble up? How can we stop the propagation of an event but keep another one registered? What does <code>touchenter</code> do? If all those questions don&rsquo;t confuse you enough, have a look at the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events\">events reference</a> ‚Äî there&rsquo;s a gazillion of them!</p>\n<p>Time for the good news! The recently updated <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/11/nic55\">Google Chrome 55</a> comes with a <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/\">Pointer Events</a> interface that will help us to unify our way of handling all input events in a hardware-agnostic way. Surprisingly <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer\">this is not</a> one of those Chrome-only features that we won&rsquo;t be able to use in production for the next decade. It&rsquo;s been implemented in Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and all Edge versions. Chrome and Opera are just joining the bandwagon. Firefox has partial support and Safari without any known info about the implementation are great candidates to use a <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/PEP\">polyfill</a> maintained by the jQuery team.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The primary goal is to provide a single set of events and interfaces that allow for easier authoring for cross-device pointer input while still allowing for device-specific handling only when necessary for an augmented experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"kill-three-birds-with-one-stone\">Kill three birds with one stone <a href=\"#kill-three-birds-with-one-stone\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Yeah three! Mouse, pen and touch. To make migration easier, the spec is designed based on the naming of most generic mouse events. For example <code>mousedown</code> becomes <code>pointdown</code>. Just by making this change we are gaining access to information like: pressure level, contact geometry, tilt etc.</p>\n<p>So instead of doing&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">somethingCool</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;mousedown&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// do some more cool stuff here\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">somethingCool</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;touchdown&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// do some more cool stuff here\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>You can simply do</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">somethingCool</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;pointerdown&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// do some more cool stuff here\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>If you would like to keep input-specific event handling by using a single pointer event you can use the <code>pointerType</code> property. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">somethingCool</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;pointerdown&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">e</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">e</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">pointerType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;mouse&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"cm\">/* mouse detected */</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;pen&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"cm\">/* pen / stylus detected */</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;touch&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"cm\">/* touch detected */</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"cm\">/* pointerType unknown or cannot be detected */</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"other-benefits-of-pointer-events\">Other benefits of Pointer Events <a href=\"#other-benefits-of-pointer-events\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Apart from providing a cleaner and unified API to deal with user inputs, Pointer Events comes with other benefits. The most important one is the performance gain that comes built-in by taking advantage of <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md\">passive event listeners</a>. Removing unnecessary blocked-by-browser events can make a huge impact on scrolling executed on touch devices. Have a look at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/65VMej8n23A\">this video</a> that shows the scrolling experience on CNN website - UX is immensely improved by using it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-it-use-it\">Love it! Use it! <a href=\"#love-it-use-it\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of polyfills I&rsquo;m going to deliberately use it going forward.

I can&rsquo;t think of a more annoying situation than being disturbed because of a missing snippet or plugin. I&rsquo;m not sure why the creators of these tools don&rsquo;t explicitly provide a solution to import / export things in an easier way. <a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a> are a great example of how to do it right ‚Äî simply pick a location where your settings should be exported to and keep this file in sync with other devices (Dropbox, iCloud, git, whatever).</p>\n<p>Text editors allow us to do the same but a small bit of hacking is required. As a long term <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> user I found keeping <a href=\"https://dotfiles.github.io/\">dotfiles on Github</a> the best solution. Very recently I jumped over to <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and I had to keep it in sync between few computers at home and at work. Let me share with you a few possible options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sync-settings-plugin-for-atom\">Sync Settings Plugin for Atom <a href=\"#sync-settings-plugin-for-atom\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings\">Sync Settings for Atom</a> is a great plugin by <a href=\"https://github.com/groupsky\">Geno Roupsky</a>. It stores all the settings, keymaps, styles, init scripts, snippets and a list of the installed packages in a single <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">gist</a>. It requires you to create a new personal <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\">access token</a> on Github and put it into the plugin settings next to the gistID. This step is required to enable the Gist (which can be public or private) to communicate with all Atom instances. The final step is to trigger a &ldquo;backup&rdquo; on the main computer from the Command Palette ‚Äî <code>cmd-shift-p</code> (macOS) or <code>ctrl-shift-p</code> (Linux/Windows). To inject the same config on another device use the &ldquo;restore&rdquo; command. To steal a config from your colleague use the &ldquo;fork&rdquo; option. It&rsquo;s easy and works like a charm!</p>\n<h2 id=\"sync-atom-with-dotfiles-on-github\">Sync Atom with dotfiles on Github <a href=\"#sync-atom-with-dotfiles-on-github\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This option is a bit more manual but gives you full control and the ability to go back in time (thanks to git). Atom stores all settings files inside the <code>~/.atom/</code> directory. The trick is to move this folder to your <code>.dotfiles</code> directory and create a symlink from this directory to the original location. If you are not familiar with the concept of using <code>.dotfiles</code>, have a look at the <a href=\"https://dotfiles.github.io/\">unofficial guide</a> which is full of great examples.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"c1\"># move .atom to .dotfiles</span>\nmv ~/.atom/ ~/.dotfiles/\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># create a symlink to the directory inside dotfiles</span>\nln -s ~/.dotfiles/.atom/ ~/.atom\n</code></pre></div><p>Time to add the new <code>.atom</code> folder to the <code>.dotfiles</code> repository. Before doing this we need to add a few folders to our <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"c1\"># Atom sync</span>\n/.atom/blob-store/\n/.atom/compile-cache/\n/.atom/packages/\n/.atom/storage/\n</code></pre></div><p>These device-specific folders don&rsquo;t store your settings. You may be wondering why did I add a <code>packages</code> folder for my <code>.gitignore</code>. The answer is easy - it stores the source files to all of your extensions and they may be heavy as hell! Does this mean that we need to manually manage the extensions? Nope :-) <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/package-sync\">Package Sync for Atom</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/lee-dohm\">Lee Dohm</a> stores a reference to all installed plugins in a <code>packages.cson</code> file. Simply install it and enable the &ldquo;Create on change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Overwrite packages.cson&rdquo; options inside the plugin settings. I&rsquo;m surprised that Atom comes with a fantastic package manager, but doesn&rsquo;t come with this functionality by default. The only option that would be amazing to have in this plugin would be &ldquo;Sync on start&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s probably only me being fussy!</p>\n<p>The thing that you may be concerned about is your <code>userId</code> being inside your <code>config.cson</code> file. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about it too much. <a href=\"https://github.com/atom/metrics/issues/18#issuecomment-36484448\">Apparently</a> it won&rsquo;t reveal anything sensitive. If it is still going to give you sleepless nights, you can simply disable the <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/exception-reporting\">Exception Reporting</a> and <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/metrics\">Metrics</a> plugins and then remove the <code>userId</code> line.</p>\n<p>Now your <code>.dotfiles</code> are fully prepared to sync your Atom settings between all of your devices. It looks a bit more complicated than the previous method but it is definitely more powerful and reliable in my experience. When you jump on a new machine just pull the <code>.dotfiles</code> repo and run the &ldquo;Package sync: Sync&rdquo; command from the Atom Command Palette ‚Äî <code>cmd-shift-p</code> (macOS) or <code>ctrl-shift-p</code> (Linux/Windows) ‚Äî job done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sync-atom-via-dropbox-or-any-other-cloud-service\">Sync Atom via Dropbox (or any other cloud service) <a href=\"#sync-atom-via-dropbox-or-any-other-cloud-service\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The last option is to use a cloud service like Dropbox. I include this method here only because it is possible in theory but in practice it is nowhere near as reliable as the two options mentioned above. Dropbox is not a speed demon. The recent <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/\">data leak</a> and <a href=\"http://applehelpwriter.com/2016/08/29/discovering-how-dropbox-hacks-your-mac/\">what it does with our operating systems</a> actually drove me to <a href=\"http://www.drop-dropbox.com/\">drop Dropbox</a>. The decision is yours.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"><span class=\"c1\"># move atom to dropbox</span>\nmv ~/.atom ~/Dropbox/Apps/Atom\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># create a symlink to the dropbox directory</span>\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Apps/Atom ~/.atom\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"this-is-how-i-do-it\">This is how I do it <a href=\"#this-is-how-i-do-it\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Sync Settings Plugin for Atom is fantastic but it doesn&rsquo;t give me an option to roll my settings back in time when I mess something up. This requirement is covered by git so that&rsquo;s why I sync it with my <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a>. And the Dropbox method? Not for me.</p>\n<p>So let me know, what do you think? Share with me your method. Do you have any suggestions? Feel free to use the comments section below.

Chris Coyier published a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/os-x-window-manager-apps/\">nice comparison</a> of the most popular ones some time ago. These apps are great utilities that can boost your productivity by eliminating the time that you normally spend adjusting the window positions on your sceen. I was using <a href=\"http://mizage.com/divvy/\">Divvy by Mizage</a> for a long time and it worked like a charm for me. Another app that I use non-stop is <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a>. It looks like the default Spotlight search feature but it is much more powerful than that. It allows you to create advanced search functionality, custom hotkeys, explore files, control apps, store snippets, use clipboard history and so on.

It is a thing that developers has been waiting for since media-queries got a first adoption few years ago. Let me quote an author what kind of a problem EQCSS solves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But when designing plugins and interfaces with element queries, we can easily write responsive styles that cover all of the situations we anticipate, making them truly bulletproof, no matter what content the user puts inside or where the plugin shows up. Suppose we could style a widget with layouts ranging from 150 to 2000 pixels wide. Then, no matter where that widget is displayed on a website, it would always look great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"es6-for-everyone-by-wes-bos\">ES6 for everyone by Wes Bos <a href=\"#es6-for-everyone-by-wes-bos\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://es6.io/\">https://es6.io/</a></p>\n<p>Great Wes Bos is coming with new amazing series.

At the time of writing, this solution was working very well for me. Today I would be using <code>window.scroll</code> and this lightweight <a href=\"https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll\">smooth scroll behavior polyfill</a> instead.</p>\n\n<p>How many times have you seen the effect of a page scrolling down after clicking a button? Probably thousands! It&rsquo;s always been extremely easy to do with the popular <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> library.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">$</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;.js-btn&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">click</span><span class=\"p\">(()</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">$</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;html, body&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">animate</span><span class=\"p\">({</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">scrollTop</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">$</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;.js-section&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">offset</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">top</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"mi\">200</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It is a decent solution, works great and it&rsquo;s really well supported across the browsers. But there is a recent trend of abandoning jQuery because pure vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation is the new hipster skill (I&rsquo;m one of those hipsters by the way). With the ease of modern APIs and the amount of features that the JavaScript landscape has to offer nowadays it is not that difficult to leave chunky libraries behind.</p>\n<p>On one recent project my client asked me to implement this kind of scrolling on his SPA (single page app). Aha! A &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; I said! Today I think &ldquo;DOM-nightmare-inconsistency-mission&rdquo; is a better term to describe this scenario. If you are one of those hipsters let me save you a couple of hours and share this tiny snippet with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"page-scrolling-without-jquery\">Page scrolling without jQuery <a href=\"#page-scrolling-without-jquery\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Plan! To start a script it&rsquo;s always a good idea to have a plan in place. Basically it goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Determine where to scroll, the duration, the easing function and an optional callback.</li>\n<li>On click ‚Äî grab a timestamp and the current document position.</li>\n<li>Scroll to the element as long as you don&rsquo;t reach the destination.</li>\n<li>If the element has finished scrolling trigger an optional callback function.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"determine-where-to-scroll-the-duration-the-easing-function-and-an-optional-callback\">Determine where to scroll, the duration, the easing function and an optional callback <a href=\"#determine-where-to-scroll-the-duration-the-easing-function-and-an-optional-callback\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>All the other steps are always going to be exactly the same. This one may vary depending on the destination, the scrolling duration, the timing function and any callback that is invoked when the scrolling reaches it&rsquo;s destination. It makes sense to pass all these things as function arguments, right? The destination is the only required argument (ideally it should be a number or DOM element, and function should determine how to deal with it). The duration and easing function possess some sensible default values (thanks to ES2015 default arguments) and the callback function should be optional. Have a look at the wrapper of our function declaration.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">scrollIt</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">destination</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">duration</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">200</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">easing</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;linear&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">callback</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// object with some some timing functions\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>  <span class=\"c1\">// function body here\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"on-click--grab-a-timestamp-and-the-current-document-position\">On click ‚Äî grab a timestamp and the current document position <a href=\"#on-click--grab-a-timestamp-and-the-current-document-position\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To calculate values for function that is responsible for scrolling window position up and down, we need to have a reference to initial window value and timestamp.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">start</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">pageYOffset</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kr\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">startTime</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;now&#39;</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">performance</span> <span class=\"o\">?</span> <span class=\"nx\">performance</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">now</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nb\">Date</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">getTime</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"scroll-to-the-element-as-long-as-you-dont-reach-the-destination\">Scroll to the element as long as you don&rsquo;t reach the destination <a href=\"#scroll-to-the-element-as-long-as-you-dont-reach-the-destination\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The most popular JavaScript animation solutions are mainly based on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout\">setTimeout</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval\">setInterval</a>, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API\">WEB Animation API</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplay/requestAnimationFrame\">requestAnimationFrame</a>. The first two are pretty old school. The Web Animation API isn&rsquo;t made to deal with these kind of situations ‚Äî read more about it in one of my previous <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/intro-to-the-web-animations-api/\">articles</a>. So <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> looks like a perfect candidate for this scenario. We have to be careful tho ‚Äî it is easy to generate infinite loop if we request a frame loop without providing condition to terminate it. One of those situation can be scrolling below available scrollable window space. Luckily it is not difficult to prevent it. In case that <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is not available we can just skip animation and move window to the destination.

Lazy loaded images on Medium.com, infinite scrolling pictures of vegan food on Pinterest or animated images on every f*****g Tumblr theme are just a few examples where this functionality can be found in abundance. <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/viewability-has-arrived-what-you-need-to-know-to-see-through-this-sea-change/\">The reporting of ad &ldquo;visibility&rdquo;</a> for monetizing purpose is another important use case. There&rsquo;s good news on the horizon though! The web platform doesn&rsquo;t have to struggle to do all these things manually anymore ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/intersection-observer/\"><code>The Intersection Observer API</code></a> just landed in <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2016/05/new-apis-to-help-developers-improve.html\">Chromium 51</a>. It allows us to do these things with ease, reduce CPU usage, increase battery life and eliminate rendering junk.</p>\n<p>Bare in mind that we are talking about a really new API. At the moment of writing this article the <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5695342691483648\">browser support</a> is restricted to Google Chrome 51 and Opera 38. If you want to play around with it in older browsers give some thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dassurma\">Surma</a> for this great <a href=\"https://github.com/surma-dump/IntersectionObserver/blob/polyfill/polyfill/intersectionobserver-polyfill.js\">polyfill</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-06-13-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"IntersectionObserver in Google Chrome Canary\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"954\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-intersection-observer-api\">How to use Intersection Observer API <a href=\"#how-to-use-intersection-observer-api\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to declare a listener that on every single scroll event triggers some crazy <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> calculations anymore. The new API is much nicer to use and read. Simply create a new instance of <code>IntersectionObserver</code> that takes two arguments ‚Äî a callback function and an optional <code>options</code> object. Trigger the <code>observe</code> method and pass in the element that should be watched. When the element enters or exits the viewport, the callback function will be fired.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">watchMe</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">IntersectionObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">callback</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">watchMe</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">observe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">elm</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>By default, the callback function will be fired whenever an element appears and leaves the viewport. The function returns an array of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/intersection-observer/#intersection-observer-entry\"><code>IntersectionObserverEntry</code></a> objects and each of them contains properties about each element that has been shown on the viewport (<code>boundingClientRect</code>, <code>intersectionRatio</code>, <code>intersectionRect</code>, <code>rootBounds</code>, <code>target</code> and <code>time</code>).</p>\n<p>The second parameter (<code>options</code>) allows you to specify some settings by passing the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/intersection-observer/#intersection-observer-init\"><code>IntersectionObserverInit</code></a> object. You can change the context (<code>root</code>) that defaults to <code>null</code> which is document‚Äôs viewport, the amount of margin from the context&rsquo;s boundaries (<code>rootMargin</code>) with a default value <code>0px</code>, and finally an array of <code>threshold</code> which is a list of thresholds at which to trigger the callback.</p>\n<p>If you need to observe more than one element, simply call the <code>observe</code> method multiple times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"demo-time\">Demo time <a href=\"#demo-time\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Have you ever heard this quote by Stephen R. Covey from &ldquo;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&rdquo;?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To learn and not to do is really not to learn. To know and not to do is really not to know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Demo time! I have created a list of paragraphs. Initially all of them are scaled down and see through. When a paragraph passes the viewport&rsquo;s edge by half of it&rsquo;s height (<code>threshold: [0.5]</code>) then it animates to its regular size and full opacity. Maybe it&rsquo;s not especially creative, but it does the job and allows you to copy/paste my code or extend it to make some super funky stuff :-)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"c1\">// the callback function that will be fired\n</span><span class=\"c1\">// when the element apears in the viewport\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">onEntry</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">entry</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">entry</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forEach</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nx\">change</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">change</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">target</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">classList</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;visible&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">});</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// list of options\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">options</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">threshold</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// instantiate a new Intersection Observer\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">observer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">IntersectionObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">onEntry</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// list of paragraphs\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">elements</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">querySelectorAll</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// loop through all elements\n</span><span class=\"c1\">// pass each element to observe method\n</span><span class=\"c1\">// ES2015 for-of loop can traverse through DOM Elements\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">elm</span> <span class=\"k\">of</span> <span class=\"nx\">elements</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">observer</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">observe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">elm</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Hopefully this has helped you out.

The answer of which one to use isn‚Äôt always easy. Each method comes with pros and cons. Should we use CSS, <code>canvas</code>, Web GL, JavaScript <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> or <code>setInterval</code>? Maybe SMIL? Oh no ‚Äî this one is dead now. Maybe some external libraries like jQuery, GreenSock or VelocityJS? These are just a few possible ways to go. If you are keen to know a little bit more about these methods, I encourage you to read a fantastic article <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/comparison-animation-technologies/\">‚ÄúA Comparison of Animation Technologies‚Äù</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> on CSS-Tricks.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLord of the twins‚Äù is the unusual description that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davatron5000\">Dave Rupert</a> named the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/\">Web Animations API</a> in ShopTalk Show <a href=\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/203-with-rachel-nabors-and-dan-wilson/\">episode</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelnabors\">Rachel Nabors</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dancwilson\">Dan Wilson</a> exclusively dedicated to this piece of the W3C spec. It is a combination of hardware accelerated CSS animations and the power of JavaScript. This high-performance API exposes powerful methods that allow us to control the animation of HTML and SVG elements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-we-ready-to-use-waapi\">Are we ready to use WAAPI? <a href=\"#are-we-ready-to-use-waapi\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Web Animations API is relatively new ‚Äî the initial version of the spec was published in June 2012. At the moment of writing this article the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation\">browser support</a> isn‚Äôt great. Even the browsers that support it offer a very inconsistent level of implementation. If you would like to play around with the bleeding edge parts of this spec then <a href=\"https://nightly.mozilla.org/\">Firefox Nightly build</a> is the best playground. Chrome and Opera are fine. <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/2INRr96R3IU/do-AigNwAwAJ\">Firefox 48 is coming</a> with WAAPI implementation on board.

The spec is a behemoth and there are so many constructors associated with the WAAPI (with more coming soon). Let‚Äôs just cover the bare minimum that allows us to create something simple.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">animate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">effect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Please don&rsquo;t confuse this native <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#dom-animatable-animate\"><code>animate()</code></a> function with the jQuery <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/animate/\"><code>animate()</code></a> function - they are not related whatsoever. The first parameter <code>effect</code> describes the movement of an animation. At the moment the only natively implemented option that can be used is an array full of keyframes. In the future browsers will allow us to use an object with an array of values (the length of array represents the number of keyframes). You can think about this parameter as an equivalent to <code>@keyframes</code> in CSS.</p>\n<p>The absolute minimum that needs to be passed in the <code>options</code> parameter is the duration in milliseconds. Luckily we can pass many more parameters to the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#animationeffecttiming\"><code>AnimationEffectTiming</code></a> object. Essentially think of this parameter as your CSS animation properties (animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay etc.).</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-believe-it-until-you-see-it\">Don&rsquo;t believe it until you see it? <a href=\"#dont-believe-it-until-you-see-it\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Enough of the theoretical gibberish ‚Äî time for a practical example.

I did this intentionally to show you how to control the offset of an animation ‚Äî it does the same job as a percentage value in front of every CSS keyframe.

Remember ‚Äî you are dealing with JS so use camel-case values from the <code>style</code> object, not the property names from CSS. For instance ‚Äî <code>margin-bottom</code> is <code>marginBottom</code>. It&rsquo;s just an example, but the animation of <code>margin</code> probably isn&rsquo;t the best idea from a performance perspective. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aerotwist\">Paul Lewis</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DasSurma\">Surma</a> created  <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/\">CSS Triggers</a> - a handy reference of triggered events associated with the animation of particular CSS properties. There is no restriction - whatever you can animate with CSS you can animate via WAAPI (including fancy <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/motion-1/\">motion-path</a> animations).</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-05-18-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"DOM style object\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1254\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Cool, but does it really generate the same effect? Not really ‚Äî the behavior of JavaScript&rsquo;s <code>easing</code> and CSS&rsquo; <code>animation-timing-function</code> is different. The WAAPI <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#time-transformations\">timing function</a> is applied to the whole iteration of an animation ‚Äî as expected. As per <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function\">MDN</a>, the CSS <code>animation-timing-function</code> is applied on each step between keyframes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For keyframed animations, the timing function applies between keyframes rather than over the entire animation. In other words, the timing function is applied at the start of the keyframe and at the end of the keyframe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have a look&hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"animation-methods-and-properties\">Animation methods and properties <a href=\"#animation-methods-and-properties\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So far we haven&rsquo;t seen any clear advantage of using WAAPI over CSS animations. Let&rsquo;s reveal the difference between reactive JavaScript over declarative CSS. When the <code>animate()</code> function is invoked a new instance of the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#the-animation-interface\"><code>Animation</code></a> interface is returned ‚Äî formerly known as <code>AnimationPlayer</code>. Assigning the animation to a variable allows us to use returned properties, methods and promises.

In the previous example we assigned the result of the <code>animate()</code> function to a variable. When <code>animate()</code> is invoked <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#dom-animatable-animate\">a few things happen</a> ‚Äî a new <code>KeyframeEffect</code> and <code>Animation</code> object is constructed, the animation starts playing and then is returned. <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#dom-animatable-animate\">Following the documentation</a> we can manually use the <code>KeyframeEffect</code> and <code>Animation</code> global objects to instantiate a new animation. The only browser that gives us an access to both of them is Firefox Nightly. Thanks again to all amazing <a href=\"https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\">polyfill</a> creators!

Instead of going deeper with my research I decided to code it by myself. <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/bricky\">Bricky</a> (thanks to my good friend Kim for this name) is a very lightweight (‚âà 1.5KB minified) and dependency-free script with a minimal number of options. It is open-source and you can download it from <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/bricky\">Github</a> or from <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bricky\">npm</a>. It did the job on my project so maybe you will find it useful as well. Have a look at the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/pawelgrzybek/pen/vGbzpW\">CodePen demo</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-05-10-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Bricky - Masonry style layout without jQuery\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"968\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work <a href=\"#how-does-it-work\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Whenever I create a project like this, I start with a blank JavaScript file that is full of commented out instructions needed to accomplish the task. My initial plan to create this plugin looked similar to the list below and it‚Äôs pretty much all of what this script is doing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Store all the articles in an array and remove them from the DOM.</li>\n<li>Create a flex wrapper inside of the element defined in settings.</li>\n<li>Dependent on the screen resolution, create columns inside the previously created wrapper (breakpoints and columns are configurable).</li>\n<li>Loop through the articles inside the array and append them one by one to the column with the least space taken.</li>\n<li>When the screen is resized, clear the container and repeat the process again. Debouncing the browser-intensive <code>resize</code> event improved the script&rsquo;s performance dramatically.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it <a href=\"#how-to-use-it\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You can inject the script into your document markup manually or use a module bundler all the cool kids are using like <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a> or <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a> to use the node-style <code>required('bricky')</code> way.

Flexbox was a buzzword some time ago, today it is a part of a spec that is well supported and widely adopted. Few months back I published an <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/\">intro to CSS grid layout module</a> that is another approaching feature that will dramatically change the way we build our projects. The enormous popularity of preprocessors like Sass or LESS undoubtedly influenced spec authors to bring variables to the language as a CSS Custom Properties. I recently published a <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-custom-properties-explained/\">post</a> that explains everything that you need to know about this powerful feature. Another aspect of preprocessors that developers and designers love are mixins. Well the good news keeps coming my friend - <a href=\"https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule/\">CSS @apply Rule</a> is just around the corner. Let&rsquo;s embrace a native CSS mixins together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This specification defines the @apply rule, which allows an author to store a set of properties in a named variable, then reference them in other style rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before we begin with some code snippets and examples I need to inform you that at the time of writing this article <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5753701012602880\">the only implementation</a> is in Google Chrome Canary with &ldquo;Experimental Web Platform features&rdquo; flag enabled.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-04-18-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Enable Experimental Web Platform Featured Flag in Google Chrome\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"848\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"syntax\">Syntax <a href=\"#syntax\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you are familiar with the syntax of CSS Custom Properties you won&rsquo;t struggle to memorize this one. Just wrap a set of properties with curly braces like that&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"nd\">:root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">--heading-style</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">font-family</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">cursive</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">font-weight</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">700</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">};</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Use the mixin via new <code>@apply</code> at-rule.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"nt\">h1</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">@apply</span> <span class=\"nt\">--heading-style</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"local-variables-in-css-mixins\">Local variables in CSS mixins <a href=\"#local-variables-in-css-mixins\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Sass allows us to pass a list of locally defined variables to a mixin. Unfortunately this isn&rsquo;t possible with the <code>@apply</code> rule.</p>\n<p>If you have some object oriented JavaScript experience, the first thing that you will try as a way around this is doing something like&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"nd\">:root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">--brand-color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">red</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">--heading-style</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">var</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nt\">--brand-color</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">font-family</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">cursive</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">font-weight</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">700</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">};</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"nt\">h1</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">--brand-color</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">green</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">@apply</span> <span class=\"nt\">--heading-style</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">/*\n</span><span class=\"cm\">brand-color value pulled from the root, not the local block\n</span><span class=\"cm\">value is red, not green\n</span><span class=\"cm\">it is CSS, not JavScript\n</span><span class=\"cm\">*/</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>&hellip;but this is not JavaScript my friend. It takes the value of the variable from the place where the mixin is defined, not from the block that is &ldquo;invoked&rdquo; in. Hopefully we will get ability to pass a parameters to a mixin at some point in the future - fingers crossed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-native-css-mixins-today\">Use native CSS mixins today <a href=\"#use-native-css-mixins-today\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As I mentioned before, the browser support for this feature is practically zero right now. <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5753701012602880\">Chrome Platform Status</a> informs us that the first implementation is planned for Google Chrome 51 (behind the flag) and Opera 38. Any details about other browsers haven&rsquo;t been revealed at the time of writing this article.</p>\n<p>As a web developers we want to use the benefits of future improvements right now! That&rsquo;s what we do with Babel and ECMAScript 2015. This is the reason why I like <a href=\"http://postcss.org/\">PostCSS</a> so much! If you have never used it yet, I highly encourage you to check my <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/from-sass-to-postcss/\">introduction</a> to PostCSS for Sass users. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pascalduez\">Pascal Duez</a> created a <a href=\"https://github.com/pascalduez/postcss-apply\">postcss-apply</a> that transpiles <code>@apply</code> rule to syntax understandable by current browsers.</p>\n<p>The feature detection for <code>@apply</code> isn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-custom-properties-explained/#detect-the-browser-support-for-css-custom-properties\">that straight forward</a> as with CSS Custom Properties. I&rsquo;m sure this is just a matter of time to standardize the way to use it with <code>@support</code> rule. If you really need to detect a support for <code>@apply</code> rule, look at the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/malyw/477cd45bd0ed501a1c3ce0870ae16dd1\">script</a> created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malyw\">Serg Gospodarets</a>.

See you next time :-*</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tabatkins\">Tab Atkins Jr</a> officially anounced that the proposal for <code>@apply</code> has been abandoned from various reasons.

My recent journey through the world of <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React.js</a> became extremely fascinating and not just because of the amazingness of this library. Spending so much time in the JavaScript environment taught me a lot of the language&rsquo;s core features. I would like to spend a few minutes showing you three easy methods that will make you a hero using arrays and give you a great start with functional programming. I will try to keep all of the examples in this article really simple, just to make the concepts discussed crystal clear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stop-looping-start-mapping\">Stop looping, start mapping <a href=\"#stop-looping-start-mapping\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\"><code>Array.map()</code></a> is a method that behaves like a loop. It creates a new array and returns values transformed by the applied callback function. It doesn&rsquo;t do anything more than the standard <code>for</code> or <code>forEach</code> can do, it just provides a much nicer notation. It always returns an array with the same length and every element corresponds to the same position in the source array. Let&rsquo;s have a look at these examples where we&rsquo;re increasing each number in a collection by one. The first one with a <code>for</code> loop and the next one using <code>.map()</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[];</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 3, 6, 9 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 3, 6, 9 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><p>And ES2015 version&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">map</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 3, 6, 9 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"filter-values-in-an-array\">Filter values in an array <a href=\"#filter-values-in-an-array\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What if we would like to create a new array based on an already existing one, but simultaneously remove all the elements that are smaller than 5? Easy, right? Write a quick loop, an if statement, and push the result to a new collection. Yes, you are right, it does the job, but let me introduce you to the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\"><code>Array.prototype.filter()</code></a> method. It works in a very similar way to <code>map()</code>, but the callback function, instead of returning a modified element, returns a boolean value that dictates if the element should be added to the new array (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>). Compared to map, <code>filter</code> doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that the length of the new array is the same as the source array. Time for some examples. Again, the first one using a <code>for</code> loop and the second one using the <code>filter()</code> method.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[];</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 5, 8 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">filter</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 5, 8 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><p>And ES2015 version&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">filter</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersNew</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// [ 5, 8 ]\n</span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"reducing-an-arrays-values-to-a-single-value\">Reducing an array&rsquo;s values to a single value <a href=\"#reducing-an-arrays-values-to-a-single-value\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Lets say we would like to sum all of the values in an array. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce\"><code>Array.prototype.reduce()</code></a> comes in handy.

Let&rsquo;s go back to our example and try to sum up all the values inside an array. Similarly to the previous examples, I will first show you a possible solution using a <code>for</code> loop, and then via the <code>reduce()</code> method.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 15\n</span></code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">reduce</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">total</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">total</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 15\n</span></code></pre></div><p>And ES2015 version&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">reduce</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nx\">total</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">total</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 15\n</span></code></pre></div><p>Wow, wow, wow! What just happened here? Easy, it is not as difficult or as magical as it looks at first glance. The names of the arguments that I used inside the callback function should give you a big hint. Let&rsquo;s go through every iteration step by step. Initially when the method <code>reduce()</code> traverses through a <code>number</code> array it will take the first value (2) of the array as the <code>total</code> argument and the second value (5) as <code>num</code>. The sum of the arguments (2 + 5) is returned (7) and is passed to the <code>total</code> argument to use in the next iteration. The array&rsquo;s third value (8) is assigned to the <code>num</code> argument. Again, the sum of these two values is returned (7 + 8). Because we don&rsquo;t have any more values in the <code>numbers</code> array, we receive 15 as the result of the <code>reduce()</code> method. Hopefully you understand the pattern.</p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that the <code>reduce()</code> method optionally accepts a second argument as the initial value. Let&rsquo;s repeat our example but with an initial value of 1000.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">reduce</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">total</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">total</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1015\n</span></code></pre></div><p>And ES2015 version&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">reduce</span><span class=\"p\">(((</span><span class=\"nx\">total</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">total</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">numbersSum</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1015\n</span></code></pre></div><p>Passing the optional initial value as a second argument slightly changes the previously described behavior. The difference is minor though. Initially it assigns 1000 to the <code>total</code> argument and the first value in the array (2) as the <code>num</code> argument.

My code editor (Sublime Text) and command line app (iTerm 2) is everything that I need. Although I have some minor experience with GUI tools, I just don&rsquo;t need them. A third opened app next to the two previously mentioned isn&rsquo;t needed. The only feature that I missed from tools like Tower 2 or SourceTree was the ability to stage small hunks of code from the same file independently and create separate commits from them. Happy days! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos\">Wes Bos</a> published a fantastic <a href=\"http://wesbos.com/git-hot-tips/\">collection of git tips and tricks</a> a few days ago, and one of them is the feature that I was always missing. Less talking, more coding!</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a file <code>helpers.js</code> full of helper functions (for brevity we&rsquo;ll keep this example simple). This file is already committed, and we spot some obvious flaws in our functions. Try to figure it out by yourself :)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesTwo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesFive</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesTen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s fix it&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesTwo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesFive</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">timesTen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">num</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">num</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s better! Now, we would like to store these changes as two separate commits (one per function).

Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>\n<pre><code>git add -p helpers.js\n</code></pre><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-03-18-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Staging a hunk of code in Command line\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"900\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Wow, git what do you want from me now?!

This isn&rsquo;t what we want to do. We need to split the current hunk into smaller hunks by typing <code>s</code>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-03-18-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Split current hunk into smaller hunks in Git\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"452\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Much better.

The vast majority of good developers highlight the benefits of written content whenever they share some thoughts about their career path. I never understood this before I tried doing it myself. Exactly one year ago I published <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/hello-there/\">my first article</a> and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier that I started. I won&rsquo;t be stopping here that&rsquo;s for sure! Let me share with you a few thoughts about my first year of blogging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-boring-stats\">No boring stats <a href=\"#no-boring-stats\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is no place here for any boring stats, simply because I have no access to the numbers. During the early days I had a Google Analytics tracking script installed, but pretty soon after it was installed I got rid of it. I decided I would rather dedicate my time to writing content instead of investigating the numbers of visitors or bounce rates (I still barely know what that is). Even now I have no clue how many people read my articles.</p>\n<p>My domain costs me ¬£6 annually and this is the only cost that I spent on the website. As a hosting I use GitHub Pages - it is totally for free. I earned on my website ¬£0. I have never thought about it as a source of income and I&rsquo;m going to be stick by this.</p>\n<p>I managed to publish 37 articles in total which averages at a serving of fresh content every 10 days. Compared to some other popular bloggers this score isn&rsquo;t impressive at all. Regardless, I&rsquo;m really proud of the work that I have done taking into consideration the fact that I have a full time job (which is not related with my personal projects), run a small online business with my good friend who lives 2000km away, care about my lovely cat and recently split with my girlfriend after a 4 year relationship. Although I&rsquo;d wish to write more, I can&rsquo;t keep that promise right now.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-03-11-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Picture of my lovely cat Bia≈Ça\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1050\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"jekyll-github-pages-and-cloudflare-turned-out-to-be-a-fantastic-setup\">Jekyll, GitHub Pages and Cloudflare turned out to be a fantastic setup <a href=\"#jekyll-github-pages-and-cloudflare-turned-out-to-be-a-fantastic-setup\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My research about the technology that I wanted to use wasn&rsquo;t intense. I decided to use the same tools that the majority of the community recommends in the age of static website generators. A <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> website hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> supercharged by <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> turned out to be a great setup. If you want to find out more about my setup, <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/jekyll-blog-on-github-pages-supercharged-by-cloudflare/\">one of my first articles</a> goes in depth about the subject. If you are planning to start your own website my advice is to not care about the platform too much. Stick to the toolkit that you are familiar with instead of spending time picking and choosing your setup - use this time to write content instead!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-went-well\">What went well <a href=\"#what-went-well\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The main benefit of blogging is definitely increasing your knowledge through writing about topics of interest. Every article requires solid preparation and research. Taking care about the quality of the content makes sense because the payback (although not monetary) will soon follow. After just a few posts I noticed that people were sharing my articles with other web developers. The satisfaction of seeing your article exchanged by the community is priceless. Some of my web gurus that I follow recommended my posts on social media channels. Some of them even follow me back on Twitter! Wawawiwa! People like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier\">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos\">Wes Bos</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/una\">Una Kravets</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelandrew\">Rachel Andrew</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpjme\">Mattias P Johansson</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helloanselm\">Anselm Hannemann</a> appreciated my efforts and shared articles on social media channels and periodic newsletters. Priceless! Thank you for your support guys!</p>\n<p>Jobs! For the past year I have received tons of job offers from around the world. Some of them are completely unrelated with my skills, these are normally roles proposed by LinkedIn recruiters. Amongst this crap there are some really tempting roles from agencies who are referring to my personal website as a starting point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-my-future-plans\">What are my future plans <a href=\"#what-are-my-future-plans\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m planning to write more and share even more valuable stuff. I would like to be involved more in the progress of our community. But most importantly - I want to keep it fun!

Despite fact that CSS is a markup language, spec creators were very generous recently and gave us a tiny, but very powerful piece of real programming capability. Excitement about native <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/\">CSS Custom Properties</a> is generally tempered by the incorrect comparison to variables used in preprocessors like <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> or <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">LESS</a>. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by this misconception! Bare with me for the rest of this article and let&rsquo;s embrace the power of this new native feature together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"syntax\">Syntax <a href=\"#syntax\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When I saw the syntax for a first time I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of it. To be honest, not much has changed since. One of the spec creators gave us a <a href=\"http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4KT0\">fair explanation</a> behind the naming decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we use $foo for variables, we&rsquo;ll be unable to use it for future &ldquo;variable-like&rdquo; things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A declaration can be made on any selector and it requires a valid identifier that starts with two dashes. Unlike other CSS properties, variable names are case-sensitive. They follow inheritance and specificity rules like all other ordinary properties. If you need a reminder on how specificity in CSS works, I encourage you to read <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-specificity-explained/\">&ldquo;CSS Specificity explained&rdquo;</a> first. The common practice is to declare it on the <code>:root</code> element to keep it accessible in all child selectors.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">--brand-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#06c</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>To reference a variable value use the <code>var()</code> function.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nt\">h1</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">brand</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"kc\">color</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Custom properties can share values between each other.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">--brand-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">#06c</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">--logo-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">brand</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"kc\">color</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>The new var function allows a fallback value in case the property wasn&rsquo;t declared beforehand.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">font-family</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">font</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">stack</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Roboto</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Helvetica</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"o\">//</span> <span class=\"nt\">Yes</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nt\">quotation</span> <span class=\"nt\">marks</span> <span class=\"nt\">are</span> <span class=\"nt\">not</span> <span class=\"nt\">needed</span>\n<span class=\"o\">//</span> <span class=\"nt\">More</span> <span class=\"nt\">about</span> <span class=\"nt\">that</span> <span class=\"nt\">here</span>\n<span class=\"o\">//</span> <span class=\"nt\">https</span><span class=\"o\">://</span><span class=\"nt\">mathiasbynens</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">be</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">notes</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">unquoted-font-family</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Variables cannot be a property name or part of a value.

The variables available in these tools are not exactly the same as CSS Custom Properties though. Further, the variables that are available in the popular <a href=\"http://postcss.org/\">PostCSS</a> plugin called <a href=\"http://cssnext.io/\">cssnext</a> use the same syntax as native CSS Custom Properties but still behave exactly the same as those from Sass or LESS. They apply a static value to the declaration during the compilation process. The new native CSS feature applies a value to a DOM element on runtime meaning that the browser allows us to reassign it. The dynamic nature of this feature allows us to take advantage of other language facilities like media queries or cascading. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the classic example that is impossible with preprocessors, but works fine with native CSS.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"nv\">$fz</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">@media</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"no\">min-width</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">60</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">$fz</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"mf\">.5</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nt\">body</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">font-size</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">fz</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>The above example applies a static <code>font-size: 1rem</code> to the <code>body</code> tag. The media query is completely ignored because a media query is not something that works in the C or Ruby compiler, it is something that works only in the browser. To make it work in Sass we have to create two separate variables and assign them depending of the breakpoint. CSS Custom Properties don&rsquo;t require the additional compilation process so the browser applies the value at runtime. When we change the width of the viewport, the value of the property is reassigned as expected.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">--fz</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">media</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nt\">min-width</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">60rem</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">root</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">--fz</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">1.5</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nt\">body</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">font-size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">fz</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>In my opinion it is freaking awesome and it opens an array of new options that weren&rsquo;t possible before.

In parallel to the new spec, a new naming system within the language was introduced which is related with the new yearly release process. The plan is to release a new version of the language every year, and ship it with <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/README.md\">features</a> that are ready at the time. ES2015 added a lot of amazing features. If you are not familiar with these fresh add-ons yet, check <a href=\"https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6\">&ldquo;ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points&rdquo;</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nzgb?lang=en\">Nicol√°s Bevacqua</a>. It&rsquo;s the best summary that I have seen so far. Luckily we shouldn&rsquo;t expect updates as huge every year which give us a chance to follow the spec.</p>\n<p>The final list of features that we&rsquo;re going to see in ECMAScript 2016 is ready and as expected, it is just a small update.

I avoided diving into the world of JavaScript for years and looking through prism of time I can see many benefits of focusing on HTML and CSS for so long. I learned it thoroughly and I know the power and restrictions that these languages come with. The HTML5 spec was finalized, and published some time ago but many people still don&rsquo;t know how to correctly use the <code>img</code> tag or <code>background-size</code> property. Today I focus exclusively on this subject and a bit about the CSS <code>cover</code> value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"image-or-background\">Image or background? <a href=\"#image-or-background\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is no official guide, and it&rsquo;s easy to understand why. Let me quote myself here (because quotes always look good in blog posts).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it part of the content, or part of the design?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Images bring semantic value to a website, and adding the <code>alt</code> tag makes it super accessible and interpreted by all user agents and screen readers. By default your browser interprets it as a printable element unless you specifically say so (massive respect if you have print.css on your website).</p>\n<p>A background image plays a decorative role in your website, it doesn&rsquo;t come with any semantic meaning or add any complementary value to the subject. <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/background\">Definition</a> taken straight from the Oxford Dictionary doesn&rsquo;t sound web-related, but offers with same meaning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The part of a design that forms a setting for the main figures or objects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"yeah-but-background-size-cover\">Yeah, but background-size: cover <a href=\"#yeah-but-background-size-cover\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In the age of responsive web design we tend to create boxes that are always nicely filled with pictures of cats or whatever. To create it we make use of <code>background-size: cover</code> definition. I described what it does on <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/background-video-made-easy/\">one of my previous articles</a> about background videos. It just works fine with adaptive and fluid layouts. Maybe this is the seventh image in your <a href=\"http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/\">completely useless carousel</a> or a featured image above an article on your Wordpress blog. It depends on the circumstances described above, but probably in many situations you ignored the rules described here! I&rsquo;m guilty of doing the same thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"object-fit-for-the-rescue\">Object-fit for the rescue <a href=\"#object-fit-for-the-rescue\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit\">The <code>object-fit</code> CSS property</a> defines how the content fits to the box. It takes few values: <code>fill</code>, <code>contain</code>, <code>cover</code>, <code>none</code>, <code>scale-down</code>. Chris Coyier already published this snappy <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/\">article</a> about all these options with an example on Codepen. Essentially, <code>fill</code> stretches object to the applied dimensions. It is probably not the most helpful value to use with RWD. <code>Contain</code> and <code>scale-down</code> behave in exactly the same way, proportionally sizing the image down to adjust to the boundaries of element without clipping it. <code>None</code> is none. <code>Cover</code> is the clear winner in terms of usability in the daily routine of designers and front end developers. As you may have guessed, it does for image exactly what <code>cover</code> does for <code>background-size</code>. The content is sized to fill the entire available space of an element. It respects the aspect ratio and clips the width or height (dependent on the proportion).</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">object-fit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">cover</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"polyfil-for-object-fit-cover\">Polyfil for object-fit: cover <a href=\"#polyfil-for-object-fit-cover\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Amazing things like this rarely come without any downsides. The only problem is Internet Explorer. I like this CSS property too much to not use it so I created a super easy JavaScript fix. If the feature isn&rsquo;t available in the browser, it grabs the source path of an image and applies it to parent element. Background-size and background-position is applied as well to imitate the same effect as <code>object-fit: cover</code>. Works fine on IE9, IE10, IE11 and Edge. If you need to support IE8, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"c1\">// Detect objectFit support\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;objectFit&#39;</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">documentElement</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span> <span class=\"o\">===</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// assign HTMLCollection with parents of images with objectFit to variable\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>  <span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">container</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">getElementsByClassName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;js-box&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// Loop through HTMLCollection\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>  <span class=\"k\">for</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Asign image source to variable\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>    <span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">imageSource</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">querySelector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;img&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">src</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Hide image\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>    <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">querySelector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;img&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">display</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;none&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Add background-size: cover\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>    <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">backgroundSize</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;cover&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Add background-image: and put image source here\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>    <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">backgroundImage</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;url(&#39;</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">imageSource</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;)&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Add background-position: center center\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>    <span class=\"nx\">container</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">style</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">backgroundPosition</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;center center&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->"},{"title":"Rounding and truncating numbers in JavaScript","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/rounding-and-truncating-numbers-in-javascript/","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/rounding-and-truncating-numbers-in-javascript/","description":"<p>Rounding and truncating is a bread and butter action for every single developer.

There is one small difference between <code>Math</code> and other built-in global objects. <code>Math</code> isn&rsquo;t a constructor which means that all properties and methods that belong to it are static (meaning that they need to be called by using Math as an object).</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-01-19-1.gif\"\n  alt=\"Math Object in Google Chrome Console\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"rounding-vs-truncating\">Rounding vs Truncating <a href=\"#rounding-vs-truncating\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The difference between these two methods is minor but very important to understand. Both of them are methods of approximating a number by dropping decimal places. Rounding approximates a number using a nearby number at a given degree of accuracy. It can occur in two directions: up and down. Rounding up approximates a number towards positive infinity. Rounding down towards negative infinity. Truncating approximates without rounding. In other words, it &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; towards zero.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">Rounding</span>\n<span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span> <span class=\"err\">‚âà</span> <span class=\"mf\">3.1416</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">Truncating</span>\n<span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span> <span class=\"err\">‚âà</span> <span class=\"mf\">3.1415</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Hopefully you get the difference. It makes truncating rarely useful in precise calculations (although JavaScript probably isn&rsquo;t a good choice at all if you need precise calculations) but you can come across a situation when it may be irreplaceable. Once example can be when needing to drop decimal places from a pixel value to avoid anti aliasing or weird pixel rounding which is completely different across browser engines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rounding-numbers-in-javascript\">Rounding numbers in Javascript <a href=\"#rounding-numbers-in-javascript\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Rounding is straight forward. We can round to the nearest integer, round down or round up. JavaScript uses three methods to achieve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Math.round()</code> - rounds to the nearest integer (if the fraction is 0.5 or greater - rounds up)</li>\n<li><code>Math.floor()</code> - rounds down</li>\n<li><code>Math.ceil()</code> - rounds up</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// 3\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.5</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>      <span class=\"c1\">// 4\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">floor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.8</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>      <span class=\"c1\">// 3\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">ceil</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>       <span class=\"c1\">// 4\n</span></code></pre></div><p>Rounding numbers with decimal precision requires a little bit of calculation and <code>Math.round()</code>. Optionally we can use the <code>toFixed()</code> method that belongs to the <code>Number</code> prototype. The output type of <code>toFixed()</code> is a <code>string</code> which needs to be passed to a top-level function called <code>parseFloat()</code> to return a <code>number</code>. Unfortunately this seems to be <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/rounding-methods-in-javascript\">really slow</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// 3.14\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span>\n<span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">toFixed</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>              <span class=\"c1\">// 3.14 returns a string\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nb\">parseFloat</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">toFixed</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// 3.14 returns a number\n</span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"truncating-numbers-in-javascript\">Truncating numbers in Javascript <a href=\"#truncating-numbers-in-javascript\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>Math.trunc()</code> simply removes all the fractional digits. It takes one argument which is a number. If the argument is a positive number it behaves exactly the same as <code>Math.floor()</code>. For negative numbers it does the same job as <code>Math.ceil()</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">trunc</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>   <span class=\"c1\">//  3\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span><span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">trunc</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mf\">3.14159</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// -3\n</span></code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the browser support for <code>Math.trunc()</code> isn&rsquo;t great. It is part of new <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-math.trunc\">ES2015 (yeah, I prefer ES6 too) specification</a>. Have a look at the browser support list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome &gt;= 38</li>\n<li>Firefox &gt;= 25</li>\n<li>Internet Explorer &gt;= Nope :(</li>\n<li>Opera &gt;= 25</li>\n<li>Safari &gt;= 7.1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Luckily there is a way to use this without ES6 support (thanks to Johny who suggested this solution in comments below). We can use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators\">bitwise operators</a> to accomplish this task. Unfortunately there are some restriction as well. All bitwise operations work on signed 32-bit integers. Using them converts a float to an integer. In practice it means that we can safely work up to <code>2^31‚àí1</code> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647_(number)\">2 147 483 647</a>) which is much less than <code>Number.MAX_VALUE</code> (1.7976931348623157e+308).

I‚Äôve read them all yet and I&rsquo;m still coming back to particular chapters quite often. The language of these books is very easy to understand and digest. Definitely my number one recommendation! Thank you Kyle for the effort and expertise that you put into the series!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-01-16-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"You Don&amp;rsquo;t Know JS by Kyle Simpson\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"933\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"frontend-masters\">Frontend Masters <a href=\"#frontend-masters\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you prefer to watch than read, <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com\">Frontend Masters</a> is a great place to start. It‚Äôs a collection of videos recorded during lessons made by JavaScript gurus. Tutors include the legendary <a href=\"http://www.crockford.com/\">Douglas Crockford</a> (he is much better with Javascript than design of his website may suggest!), mentioned above <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify\">Kyle Simpson</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhusain\">Jafar Husain</a> from Netflix. The monthly subscription for these videos costs only $39, but for first month you only have to pay half. If you‚Äôre still not convinced, have a look at list of [https://frontendmasters.com/customers-love-frontend-masters/](testimonials on the website).</p>\n<h2 id=\"eggheadio\">Egghead.io <a href=\"#eggheadio\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://egghead.io/\">Egghead</a> is another great resource if you prefer watching over reading. Whilst you can pay for monthly subscription, you can also watch tons of amazing resources completely free. The majority of courses on Egghead are JavaScript related. It‚Äôs full of resources for beginners, more experienced users and people keen to learn popular frameworks like Angular or React.js.</p>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-the-good-parts-by-douglas-crockford\">JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford <a href=\"#javascript-the-good-parts-by-douglas-crockford\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742\">JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford</a> is a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô for any JavaScript developer. It‚Äôs a slim but concise and opinionated book about the best parts of the language. Although Douglas Crockford may be a controversial author within the community, he‚Äôs made so many good things for JS community that we should to thankful for. I should state that this book is not for beginners, as it requires at last a basic understanding of the syntax to get the most from it. Again - must have!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2016-01-16-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"933\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"youtube--twitter\">YouTube &amp; Twitter <a href=\"#youtube--twitter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Luckily many JavaScript developers are generous with their time and knowledge which they share on Twitter and YouTube. Find your mentors and follow them. My only advice here is not to follow everyone ‚Äî following everybody is like following no-one. If I had to pick a single Twitter or YouTube account that is worth to following, that would be a new live broadcast podcast called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJYTMGbtBliMSG8gadRHK2Q\">JavaScript Air</a> which is hosted by the super-active and follow-worthy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\">Kent C.

Every single snippet of code that you come across, you should type in your browser‚Äôs console and experiment with. This reminder is on the beginning of every single programming book, every video and I‚Äôm repeating it again! Practice is a best teacher. Type your code!</p>\n<p>Please, use comments below to share with me your helpers, blogs, books, articles, YouTube channels‚Ä¶ Happy learning guys :-)</p>"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2015 December","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-december/","pubDate":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-december/","description":"<p>Internet is full of interesting, useful or funny things.

It‚Äôs a pleasure for our eyes to see a little bit of modern looking movement on a website. Unfortunately our browser doesn‚Äôt love videos like we do. Good performance isn‚Äôt a friend with videos neither. I have come across many websites with autoplayed videos hosted on vimeo or youtube that use crazy amount of bandwidth. Some minimal looking websites with full HD video in the background even triggered the fans on my laptop.

As you can see I have added some attributes to <code>video</code> tag. Hopefully <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code> and <code>muted</code> don‚Äôt need any explanation. <code>poster</code> includes a path to the image that will be displayed on the mobile devices. When the video isn‚Äôt ready or it‚Äôs paused, you browser will show this poster instead. It is a good practice to create a poster from the first frame of your video.</p>\n<p>Multiply <code>source</code> element is needed to provide a cross browser experience. If you need to support old Firefox browsers you need to add ogg format as well. You can generate all those formats with tools like <a href=\"http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/\">Miro Converter</a> or my favourite online <a href=\"https://html5backgroundvideos.com/converter/\">HTML5 Video Converter</a>. Please control the size of your files. It is a difficult task to find a compromise between length, quality and file size. I always try to compress my videos to something between 500kb - 1000kb, and avoid videos longer than 10 - 15 seconds. <a href=\"https://handbrake.fr/\">HandBrake</a> is open source video transcoder that can halp you with compression.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">banner</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">position</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">relative</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">overflow</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">hidden</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">banner__video</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">position</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">absolute</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">top</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">50</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">left</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">50</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">min-width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">min-height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">transform</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">translateX</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">-50</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nb\">translateY</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">-50</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">z-index</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">-1</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>This is the trick. Position everything on centre, add minimum width and height to fill the space of the parent div, hide everything that is outside of the box, and place the video behind the content of the parent.</p>\n<p>We made it, it works fine but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be improved. Let‚Äôs have a look at few more tricks that can enhance this effect and the user experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-poster-on-ios\">Video poster on iOS <a href=\"#video-poster-on-ios\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Mobile browsers are very clever and they ignore <code>autoplay</code> attribute to save valuable bandwidth. All Android devices will display the poster image but iOS devices will display huge play button in the middle of a player. It sucks.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-12-06-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Play icon iOS video tag\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"888\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>We definitely don‚Äôt want to keep it like that. A few lines of JavaScript comes in help here. Essentially we need to grab the value of the poster attribute and apply it as a background-image of the parent element. Additionally we need to add a correct background-size and background-position to this div and hide video tag.

We need to create a small pattern and then overlay it over the video by adding a <code>background-image</code> on the parent element. These files are normally very small so we can easily convert them to base64 data to save server requests (it doesn&rsquo;t really matter in age of HTTP2). If you use Emmet in Sublime Text or Atom, you can use a shortcut <code>Shift + Ctrl + D</code>.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-12-06-3.gif\"\n  alt=\"ENcode Decode base 64 Emmet in Sublime Text 3\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.patternify.com/\">Paternity</a> is a super cool tool that you can use to quickly generate base64 patters.

It is created by some very clever guys from Russia‚Äôs largest search engine ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.yandex.com/\">Yandex</a>.</p>\n<p>BEM requires a lot of typing, but Emmet helps you to create a markup with less typing. You probably can guess where I‚Äôm going with this. If not, have a look at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/648907410929664000\">Wes‚Äôs tweet</a> that inspired me to dive into the subject.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emmet-filters\">Emmet filters <a href=\"#emmet-filters\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Emmet is of the best things ever made for developers. It allows you to expand small abbreviations to serious chunks of code. Have a look at this easy example:</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-17-1.gif\"\n  alt=\"Emmet\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Cool, yeah? I hope that you‚Äôre already using it, but if not go <a href=\"http://emmet.io/download/\">here</a> and download the extension to your editor of choice. But that‚Äôs not everything that it comes with. One of the features are filters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Filters are special post-processors that modify expanded abbreviation right before output to the editor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using filters is as easy as passing pipe (<code>|</code>) followed by shortcut of a filter after abbreviation. Let‚Äôs make our output single-lined by passing the <code>|s</code> filter.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-17-2.gif\"\n  alt=\"Emmet filters\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"bem-block-element-modifier\">BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) <a href=\"#bem-block-element-modifier\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This article is not about how amazing or ugly this methodology is. It works for me on the majority of my projects and it helps me a lot to keep my project well organised. If you would like to learn more about it, I highly recommend you read <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/\">official documentation</a> or <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\">Harry‚Äôs article</a>. Developer‚Äôs preference are different and some prefer to separate blocks and elements by a single underscore, some prefer double underscores. It‚Äôs the same with the modifier classes, some prefer a single hyphen, some prefer double hyphens. I prefer to follow the official notation with double separators. Let‚Äôs stick to the <code>article</code> example and have a look at how to BEMify this markup:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">article</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;post&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;post__title&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;post__date&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;post__content&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">article</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"using-bem-filter-with-emmet\">Using BEM filter with Emmet <a href=\"#using-bem-filter-with-emmet\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You know about filters, you know about BEM. Let‚Äôs have a look at how to apply the <code>|bem</code> filter in practice:</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-17-3.gif\"\n  alt=\"Emmet bem filter\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Love it! Massive time saver! If you use Sublime Text you may need to apply your own settings to customise the output for your needs. Just go to <code>Preferences -&gt; Package settings -&gt; Emmet -&gt; Settings - User</code>. My configuration file looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;syntaxProfiles&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;html&#34;</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&#34;filters&#34;</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;html, bem&#34;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;preferences&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;bem.elementSeparator&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;__&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;bem.modifierSeparator&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;--&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&#34;bem.shortElementPrefix&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;-&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>As you can see I applied the <code>html</code> and <code>bem</code> filter as the default one for all <code>.html</code> files. It allows even more simplification of the process by omitting the filter in the abbreviation. Hopefully this article helped you to speed up your BEM workflow. Please share your thoughts, favourite Emmet features or methodologies that you use.</p>"},{"title":"Lets get into the basics of CSS Grid Layout Model","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/","pubDate":"Sun, 04 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/","description":"<p>CSS is getting stronger and gives us much more power than a few years ago. It is difficult to miss the huge buzz about Flexbox recently. This powerful part of CSS is well supported in all modern browsers and you don&rsquo;t have an excuse for not using it yet. I found it very helpful in some circumstances, but it&rsquo;s definitely not the ideal candidate for building entire layouts. We tend to build them using floating or inline blocking elements, but it‚Äôs definitely not reason why these features were created. For me this is a broken idea, exactly the same like using fonts for icons. CSS never had a built in feature just for building layouts so we don‚Äôt have a much choice and we need to use these hacks. The good news is that CSS Grid Layout Model is just around the corner and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to using it. Let&rsquo;s dive into it together and rebuild some standard looking layout using some basic features of brand new model.</p>\n<p>At the point of writing this article <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid\">browser support for CSS Grid Layout Model</a> is minimal. The only browsers that supports it are Edge and latest Internet Explorer. Luckily we have full implementation of that feature in Google Chrome, not as a default setting though. The only thing that we need to do is to switch the &lsquo;Enable experimental Web Platform&rsquo; flag and restart the browser.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-1.gif\"\n  alt=\"Enable experimental Web Platform Flag\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"standard-blog-layout-revisited\">Standard blog layout revisited <a href=\"#standard-blog-layout-revisited\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A few years ago it was close to impossible to visit a blog without header on top, content section and narrow sidebar under neath followed by a footer. Despite many <a href=\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/185-this-idea-must-die/\">discussions about the existence of the sidebar</a>, this is still a very popular blog layout and it&rsquo;s going to work well as an example.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Standard blog layout\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"gridy-terminology\">Gridy terminology <a href=\"#gridy-terminology\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Before we go any further it&rsquo;s necessary to mention a little bit of related terminology. Easy, just few new words, hopefully your brain won&rsquo;t explode. Knowledge of these few terms will make your further grid exploration much easier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grid container</li>\n<li>Grid lines</li>\n<li>Grid track</li>\n<li>Grid cell</li>\n<li>Grid area</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"grid-container\">Grid container <a href=\"#grid-container\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/#grid-model\">Grid container</a> establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents. Essentially, it is our parent selector which is forming the boundaries of inner grid items.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS Grid container\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"grid-lines\">Grid lines <a href=\"#grid-lines\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/#grid-line-concept\">Grid lines</a> are the horizontal and vertical dividers. We are going to use them to describe grid tracks, grid cells and grid areas. They have a numerical index, or optionally we can give them a specific name.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS Grid lines\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"grid-track\">Grid track <a href=\"#grid-track\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/#grid-track-concept\">Grid track</a> is a vertical or horizontal space between two lines.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-5.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS Grid track\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"grid-cell\">Grid cell <a href=\"#grid-cell\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/#grid-track-concept\">Grid cell</a> is the item between two adjacent horizontal and two adjacent vertical grid lines. It is the smallest unit that we can put content into.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-6.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS Grid cell\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"grid-area\">Grid area <a href=\"#grid-area\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/#grid-area-concept\">Grid area</a> is very similar to grid cell, it&rsquo;s bounded by any two horizontal and two vertical grid lines (not necessarily adjacent). Theoretically speaking, grid cell is the smallest form of grid area.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-7.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS Grid area\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-all-about-grid-areas-between-grid-lines\">It&rsquo;s all about grid areas between grid lines <a href=\"#its-all-about-grid-areas-between-grid-lines\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Enough of boring theory now, lets get our hands dirty with some code. This is the markup of our super complex example.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;blog&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;header&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Header<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;content&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Content<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;sidebar&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Sidebar<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;footer&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Footer<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Finally the exciting part. To enable grid layout we need to apply <code>grid</code> value for <code>display</code> property. For additional settings I‚Äôm going to use absolute values (pixels) just for simplicity of my example, but in real life scenario it‚Äôs probably a better idea to use some relative values (percentage, ems, rems, vw or vh). New properties <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> will split grid container for few grid tracks. You can easily use <code>auto</code> instead of fixed values for these properties. Look at the code and compare applied values with the picture below.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">blog</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">display</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">grid</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">grid-template-columns</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">400</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">180</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">grid-template-rows</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">210</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-10-04-8.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CSS grid template columns and rows\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1100\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Time to define how our grid looks.

There are a number of solutions to handle features incompatibility. It can be some CSS hack that overrides the previous rule, or JavaScript snippet that returns boolean value that dictates further steps. Possibly you came across more advanced solutions like <a href=\"https://modernizr.com/\">Modernizr</a>, which has been updated recently and brought us so many new checks.</p>\n<p>There is one more method, not that widely used yet. One of the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule\">CSS at-rules</a> is <code>@supports</code>. It gives us very intuitive way to check browser capabilities.

Last big update like that happened in 2009 when ES5 has been officially revealed. As always the biggest problem with new standards is browsers compatibility (incompatibility suits better here). This is the only reason that restrains developers from using latest standards. Fortunately we have a <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> (formerly known as 6to5). It allows you to use new syntax by transpiling your ECMAScript 2015 into ES5 code, that works fine in current JavaScript environments.

That‚Äôs what bookmarks are made for, yeah? Standard bookmarks in your browser are fine as long as you don‚Äôt have many of them. Things are getting more complicated when you have hundreds or sometimes thousands of URLs worth revisiting. Services like Pocket or do the job pretty well, but <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a> gives you a real power.</p>\n<p>Pinboard is a bookmarking service created in 2009 by a polish developer Maciej Ceg≈Çowski. The difference between his project and mentioned before popular bookmarking services is huge. First ‚Äî Pinboard is ugly compared to competitors. Second ‚Äî you need to pay money for it (yearly cost is equal to two pints of good beer). You are probably thinking now ‚ÄúWhy should I pay for an ugly bookmarking service?‚Äù but the answer is easy. It works!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-09-10-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Pinboard - main view\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"925\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-tested-many-of-them\">I tested many of them‚Ä¶ <a href=\"#i-tested-many-of-them\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As everybody, I started from bookmarks in my browser. Then I moved all this mess to Pocket, Digg later on, then I tested Google Bookmarks, then Delicious and then I lost my hope to find something that simply works fine. Some time ago I finally found the hero of this post - <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a>. Importing list items from competitors cannot be easier. After months of using it I feel that I will never move my stuff somewhere else. Why? Let me mention a few really strong reasons why should you try it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookmarks-tags-and-tags-bundles\">Bookmarks, tags and tags bundles <a href=\"#bookmarks-tags-and-tags-bundles\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Adding new URLs to your collection can‚Äôt be easier and quicker. Pinboard is lightning fast! You can use small JavaScript snippets or install a browser extension. Tags are very useful to keep your finds filterable. Consistent way of adding tags and describing your items makes so much sense, especially if you work with hundreds or thousands of links. Optional ‚Äòtags bundle‚Äô is an experimental feature that makes managing your collection much neater (I don‚Äôt know why this feature is experimental ‚Äî works 100% fine for me). Well documented API gives independent developers ability to integrate service with their tools. I use on a daily basis few apps (mainly Mac OS X and iOS Reeder and iOS Pinswift) that are using this API, and it works brilliant. Smooth integration with maximum three Twitter accounts can be a nice selling point for some users.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-09-10-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Pinboard integration in Reeder and Pinswift\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1178\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"bye-bye-instapaper-and-readability\">Bye bye Instapaper and Readability <a href=\"#bye-bye-instapaper-and-readability\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, these services are amazing and I still like them, I just don‚Äôt need them anymore. Pinboard comes with ‚Äòread later‚Äô option. It just works as a reminder of things that you would like to watch or read in the feature. Bookmark, read or watch, mark as a read, done ‚Äî as easy as that!</p>\n<h2 id=\"tab-sets\">Tab sets <a href=\"#tab-sets\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Next to standard bookmarks, ‚Äòtab sets‚Äô is definitely my favourite feature. Essentially you can save a collection or currently opened tabs in your browser, and recover the same tabs via one click later on. I know there is many extensions to do that, but why should I use them if this awesome feature comes with something that I already use? I found it really useful when I work on my Mac Mini and then I want carry on with my Macbook on the train.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support\">Support <a href=\"#support\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>To be honest, you will never need to contact Maciej directly because the documentation is amazing and very detailed. If you really struggle with something you can ask on Twitter and I‚Äôm sure you will get your answer immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-you-use-pinboard\">Should you use Pinboard? <a href=\"#should-you-use-pinboard\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As always ‚Äî it depends. If you constantly saving new stuff with hope to come back to it later you definitely should give it a try. I do not regret this tiny fee that I spent on <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a>, and you won‚Äôt neither.</p>\n<p>Let me know about your experiences with bookmarking services. Maybe you built some app that is using Pinboard API ‚Äî let me know, I‚Äôm keen to give it a try. Happy bookmarking :)</p>"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2015 August","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-august/","pubDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-august/","description":"<p>Internet is full of interesting, useful or funny things.

You pick extra functionality and add them to your process by yourself. If you need variables, you need to install small plugin and now you have a CSS with variables. If you need nesting on top of that, one more plugin and your CSS is now supercharged by variables and nesting. You get it now. Because you use only the things that you need it makes the entire process super fast.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PostCSS can do the same work as preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus. But PostCSS is modular, 3-30 times faster, and much more powerful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-08-27-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"PostCSS.parts website\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"1027\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"grunt-gulp-broccoli\">Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli‚Ä¶ <a href=\"#grunt-gulp-broccoli\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is many options to get your PostCSS running. Configurations is dead easy and it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage\">well described on Github</a>. I use <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\">gulp.js</a> as a build system and it <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/gulp-postcss\">works very well</a> with it. If you struggle to set it up, <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/build-css-preprocessor-postcss/\">‚ÄúHow to Build Your Own CSS Preprocessor With PostCSS‚Äù by Craig Buckler</a> is a good resource to start with. Another very helpful resource to get your head around it is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFvjZzyYrQP0RTsG-Al7j9m\">PostCSS Tutorials</a> by Scott Tolinski from Level Up Tuts. Sometimes I can‚Äôt believe all the videos that this guy is doing are available to watch for free. I highly recommend a different series by Scott (ie. Gulp or Sketch are very good).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-use\">What I use <a href=\"#what-i-use\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As I said earlier I try to restrict my toolkit to a minimum but it does‚Äôt mean I want to forget about amazing things like partials or variables. There is a few add-ons that I can‚Äôt live without and let me show you how it works. The majority of them work exactly the same as they do in Sass.</p>\n<h3 id=\"partials-and-imports\">Partials and imports <a href=\"#partials-and-imports\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I can‚Äôt imagine to work with CSS without meaningful order of my partials files. Plugin that I use to make it work is <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import\">postcss-import</a>. I kept the Sass naming convention with a single prefix underscore for partial files.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"c\">/* Code looks like */</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;_typography.css&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"variables\">Variables <a href=\"#variables\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sass style variables you can add via <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars\">postcss-simple-vars</a>.

I&rsquo;m sure I will write more posts about PostCSS in near future, so please stay tuned!</p>"},{"title":"I won't miss you Adobe","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/","description":"<p>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Fireworks were web design industry standard for many years. Everybody is familiar with these tools not because they are incredibly amazing but because they were the only choice. Some time ago Adobe changed their sales model to a monthly subscription. So many web developers and designers (including myself) were not very happy with that politics. Fortunately few new applications came out recently and finally we have the opportunity to use something else. I have tested a few of them: Sketch for UI and Pixelmator and Affinity Photo for photo retouching. Finally I&rsquo;m ready to leave Adobe‚Äôs world!</p>\n<p>My toolset of choice is Sketch + Affinity Photo. I can&rsquo;t describe how amazing these two tools are. Pixelmator is an amazing piece of software as well, but it doesn&rsquo;t do anything that I&rsquo;m not able to do with Affinity Photo. Let me list few things that I like the most in my new set of design software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"money-money-money\">Money, money, money <a href=\"#money-money-money\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Of course the main reason that pushed me to look for new tools was the super high price of Adobe‚Äôs subscription. The minimum that I need to accomplish in my daily tasks is a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. Lets compare the price of these apps with my current toolkit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adobe Creative Cloud: <strong>¬£45.73 per month</strong></li>\n<li>Sketch 3: <strong>¬£79.99</strong></li>\n<li>Affinity Photo: <strong>¬£39.99</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a math genius to notice that two months of subscription of Adobe Creative Cloud costs you about the same price like lifetime licence for Sketch and Affinity Photo. I like it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-talk-about-performance\">Let&rsquo;s talk about performance <a href=\"#lets-talk-about-performance\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I prefer to use apps that do what I need and not much more. Sublime Text is a good example. It comes as a very plain text editor and if I need to add some missing feature, a small plugin solves the problem. Photoshop is a perfect example of an application that is the absolutely opposite. Things like 3D or video editing built in the core of Photoshop is a crap idea. I&rsquo;m assuming that I have used maybe 1% of the available features, if not less. It causes performance issues. I like their competitors approach. Literally everything that you need and not much more. If you need a super cool feature in Sketch, I&rsquo;m more than sure you can find a plugin to do that. Affinity Photo includes everything that I need, easy interface to work with and performance is so much better than in PS. As I expected from photo retouching tool it does it very well and not much more.</p>\n<p>All these features takes some space on your hard drive. It is definitely not the most important factor for me, but I just don&rsquo;t like to keep things that I don&rsquo;t need. Let&rsquo;s have a look as required space on our machines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adobe Photoshop CC 2015: <strong>1.78GB</strong></li>\n<li>Sketch 3: <strong>38MB</strong></li>\n<li>Affinity Photo: <strong>575MB</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"icloud-integration\">iCloud integration <a href=\"#icloud-integration\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Open, done! Save, done! Open on different computer and do some changes, done! Quick and easy. Thanks to iCloud integration. I&rsquo;m aware of Creative Cloud, but do I really need another cloud in my life?</p>\n<h2 id=\"photoshop-is-made-for-photos-not-graphics-interfaces\">PHOTOshop is made for photos, not graphics interfaces <a href=\"#photoshop-is-made-for-photos-not-graphics-interfaces\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It never worked for me as a UI tool. Things like broken pixel snapping or totally unpredictable typefaces rendering drives me nuts. These are the things that you don&rsquo;t want to spend time on to fix and be focused on design instead. For photos retouching I can&rsquo;t think of a better tool. The problem is I&rsquo;m not a retoucher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features <a href=\"#features\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to describe in depth about available features because you can find hundreds articles like that on <a href=\"https://medium.com/sketch-app\">Medium.com</a>. I just want to say that Sketch and Affinity Photo gives me everything that I need for basic design tasks. Things like pages and artboards in Sketch or saving pretty well compressed .jpgs for web are amazing. All the cool features are very intuitive and well documented in the help tab.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-wont-miss-you-adobe\">I won&rsquo;t miss you Adobe <a href=\"#i-wont-miss-you-adobe\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I wish to see Adobe&rsquo;s update soon that will make theirs tools fresh and modern like they were few years ago. For now I&rsquo;m more than happy to use my brand new toolkit and I&rsquo;m ready to get rid of every Adobe app from my computer.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion about Adobes recent changes? What is your toolkit of choice? Hmm? Photoshop addicts, how much do you hate me now?</p>"},{"title":"Fix privileges and never again use sudo with npm","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/fix-priviliges-and-never-again-use-sudo-with-npm/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/fix-priviliges-and-never-again-use-sudo-with-npm/","description":"<p class=\"update\">Nah! Don&rsquo;t do it! I published this article years ago. It was a solution provided by npm team by the time of writing this article. Use <code>nvm</code> or <a href=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/homebrew-the-best-friend-of-the-macos-user/\">brew</a> instead please.</p>\n\n<p>We have a few options to install Node and npm. Using <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is the safest and recommended way to do it. Another safety option is using <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm\">Node Version Manager</a>. Next method is using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">installer available on official node website</a>. This way is the most obvious and the easiest one, but not necessarily the safest one. Fortunately there is a very easy fix.</p>\n<p>If you used installer, whenever you want to install a package globally you need to use a super user power to do it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\n</code></pre><p>On a first glance it&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that code, yeah? Even on official Grunt documentation it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may need to use sudo (for OS X, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually it is a very dangerous thing. Correctly pointed out by my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IcyApril\">friend</a> recently, I started investigate the problem and I found an amazing article by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/givanse\">Gast√≥n I. Silva</a> ‚Äî <a href=\"http://givan.se/do-not-sudo-npm/\">Do not sudo npm</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should not run applications with root privileges if its not necessary. Node and npm can do their work just perfectly fine without admin powers. If you are running a server with root privileges and it gets hacked through a vulnerability in your code, the attacker will have total control over your machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need troubles. We need to change privileges on few folders on our machine. The procedure is very simple and it&rsquo;s very clearly explained on <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\">one of the videos</a> on the official npm documentation website. Open Terminal and type:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share\n</code></pre><p>These few lines of code are very straight forward. It changes the owner of listed directories from root to your user name. Flag -R stands for &lsquo;recursively&rsquo; which means it changes ownership on particular directory and all directories and files inside it.</p>\n<p>Enjoy using npm without &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; now.</p>"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2015 July","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-july/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-july/","description":"<p>Internet is full of interesting, useful or funny things.

No doubt! Yes, it is even trickier than floats, trust me! I hang out with many web developers on a daily basis and I assume that lack of understanding of this concept is most frequently the reason of confusion. Let me quote <a href=\"http://cssguidelin.es/#specificity\">Harry Roberts</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we‚Äôve seen, CSS isn‚Äôt the most friendly of languages: globally operating, very leaky, dependent on location, hard to encapsulate, based on inheritance‚Ä¶ But! None of that even comes close to the horrors of specificity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-css-specificity\">What is CSS Specificity? <a href=\"#what-is-css-specificity\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>First lets have a look at a definition from <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity\">Mozilla Developer Network</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Specificity is the means by which a browser decides which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and therefore will be applied. Specificity is only based on the matching rules which are composed of CSS selectors of different sorts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The definition is straight forward, so why can we experiencing issues? It starts when few selectors apply to the same element. Look!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;myclass&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">id</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;myid&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">style</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;color: yellow&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">green</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">myclass</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">red</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">#</span><span class=\"nn\">myid</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">blue</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>What is the color of that paragraph?

We can separate CSS rules to 4 main categories and each of them adds a different value to specificity score. The correct notation of specificity score takes a form that separates points by coma in an appropriate order.

There is a list of fantastic methodologies that you can grasp and use. My personal choice of combinations are <a href=\"https://smacss.com/\">SMACSS</a> by Jonathan Snook and <a href=\"https://tech.yandex.com/bem/\">BEM naming convention</a> by Yandex. Read more about these two approaches or <a href=\"http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-methodologies/\">many alternatives here</a>. Low selectors specificity is always one of the advantages of using some CSS methodologies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-not-use-ids\">Do not use IDs <a href=\"#do-not-use-ids\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Despite that it‚Äôs absolutely valid it‚Äôs very poor practice to use IDs to style elements. Accordingly to the previous rule, we are suppose to keep the specificity score as low as we can. Another reason avoid it is the fact that they can‚Äôt be reused. But it‚Äôs all about reusing components! Right?! If you need more reasons, check <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nesting-isnt-cool-at-all\">Nesting isn‚Äôt cool at all <a href=\"#nesting-isnt-cool-at-all\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Nesting is probably one of the most overused thing in CSS. Preprocessors sell nesting as a feature that combines selectors in more readable and easier to apply way. In fact, nesting should be avoided wherever possible. It‚Äôs another case where decent naming convention comes to the rescue! The rule of thumb is to not nest more than 4 levels. Funny guys from <a href=\"http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule\">The Sass Way</a> called this the ‚ÄúInception Rule&rdquo; ‚Äî if you have watched the &ldquo;Inception&rdquo; movie you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Another reason was described in fantastic article <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com/2015/04/cyclomatic-complexity-logic-in-css/\">‚ÄúCyclomatic Complexity: Logic in CSS‚Äù by Harry Roberts</a>. Let me quote a sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of your selectors as mini programs: Every time you nest or qualify, you are adding an if statement; read these ifs out loud to yourself to try and keep your selectors sane.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"forget-about-important\">Forget about !important <a href=\"#forget-about-important\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Last resort of specificity war.

You can read tons of books and articles, attend reputable conferences and watch many videos but you are wasting your time if you won&rsquo;t practice it. Google Chrome Javascript Console isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable tool for sure. Tools like <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">jsbin.com</a> or <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/\">jsfiddle.net</a> are super cool but lets confirm that, nothing is more convenient to write a piece of code than your favourite editor. Let me share with you how you can test your JavaScript scripts and execute it via <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/file_processing/build_systems.html\">build systems</a> feature in Sublime Text 3.</p>\n<p>Build systems allows you to run your files through external programs without manually switching between code editor and Terminal. Sublime Text comes with few predefined profiles.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-06-12-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Domain&amp;rsquo;s DNS settings\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"728\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Our mission is to add a new one for JavaScript. We are going to use <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">node.js</a>. Make sure it is already installed on your device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-javascript-build-system-in-sublime-text\">Create JavaScript build system in Sublime Text <a href=\"#create-javascript-build-system-in-sublime-text\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Every built system is described on JSON file with <code>.sublime-build</code> extension. To create new one go to Tools &gt; Build System &gt; New Build System&hellip; If you are mac OS user, copy and paste this bit of code:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;cmd&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;/usr/local/bin/node&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;$file&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;selector&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;source.js&#34;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Windows users&hellip;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;cmd&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;$file&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;selector&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;source.js&#34;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>In most cases single <code>node</code> command does the job instead of passing a full path to node. I found this method more reliable though. If you are not sure where node is installed, just type <code>which node</code> in Terminal (mac OS) or <code>where node</code> in command prompt (windows users) to get the path.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-06-12-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Domain&amp;rsquo;s DNS settings\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"728\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Save this file as a JavaScript.sublime-build in &ldquo;User&rdquo; directory inside Sublime Text settings folder.</p>\n<p>Time for fun part. Create and save a JavaScript file (to execute a node interpreter, file needs to be saved), code some super amazing script and click Cmd + B (mac OS) or F7 (Windows). You can run this task manually from Tools &gt; Build. Sublime Text should automatically run your script through appropriate build system. If something doesn&rsquo;t work correctly go to Tools &gt; Build System and make sure that Automatically or JavaScript is selected. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-06-12-3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Domain&amp;rsquo;s DNS settings\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"952\"\n/>\n</p>"},{"title":"Top picks ‚Äî 2015 May","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-may/","pubDate":"Sun, 31 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2015-may/","description":"<p>Internet is full of interesting, useful or funny things.

They all do the same job. Some of them are terribly ugly and difficult to use, some of them are fantastic and so powerful. Let me point what needs to be possible in good grid system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>easy to use</li>\n<li>using own markup</li>\n<li>nest grids</li>\n<li>reorder columns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the most important things for me is to use my own markup. I don‚Äôt want to use extra classes to describe my layout. It can be ugly and makes my markup so cluttered! Why do I have to use something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"nt\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;post column small-6 medium-4 large-3 x-large-2&#34;</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">post</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>If I need just:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span> <span class=\"nt\">class</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&#34;post&#34;</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">post</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">div</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Sometimes we need to nest grids. Lets say we have a two columns and inside one of them we need well aligned gallery. Thats the case when grid nesting comes handy.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-05-09-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Nestes grids\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"560\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>It is definitely not the best technique to place the most important content somewhere close to end of our html document. From SEO reasons is better to keep important things as close as possible. Correct me please if I‚Äôm wrong. What should we do if we have a sidebar on left hand side and main content div on right side? There is so many tricks to reorder content and we need to be able to do it as well. It&rsquo;s not important only from SEO point of view. Having a better control and changing the order dependable of viewport is a main thing.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-05-09-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Reordered columns inside grid system\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"1400\"\n  height=\"560\"\n/>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"rows-and-columns\">Rows and columns <a href=\"#rows-and-columns\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thats it! Every single grid system creates some rows and columns. Row wraps things together and column sets specific width to en element. With this information in mind lets have a look at bits of code below.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">wrapper</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">max-width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">80</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">margin-left</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">margin-right</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">wrapper</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">before</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">wrapper</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">after</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">display</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">table</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">wrapper</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nd\">after</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">clear</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">both</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Thats the way how we create element that wraps columns together and keeps everything centered. We can adjust maximum width of that element and use any absolute or relative units to set maximum width up. Because we are going to use floating elements inside that div, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/\">clearfix</a> is necessary here. Lets have a look at second puzzle.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-css\" data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">column</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">float</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">left</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">50</span><span class=\"kt\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">padding-left</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">padding-right</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Columns are straight forward. Floating of that element allows us to place columns next to each other. Padding on left and right hand side gives us a gutter between columns. Thing that we can customise here is width and gutter. Percentage based width value is best option to create fluid layouts. I like to have all my gutters equal, thats why I use paddings to create a gutters between columns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grid-system-via-two-sass-mixins\">Grid system via two SASS mixins <a href=\"#grid-system-via-two-sass-mixins\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We know already the general idea behind every grid system. Lets convert our CSS snippets into SASS mixins.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-scss\" data-lang=\"scss\"><span class=\"cm\">/* Variables */</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">$wrapper</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">80</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">$gutter</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"kt\">rem</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">/* Row */</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@mixin</span><span class=\"nf\"> row</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$inside</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">false</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">@if</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$inside</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">margin-left</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">-</span><span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">gutter</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">margin-right</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">-</span><span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">gutter</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">@else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">width</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">100</span><span class=\"err\">%</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">max-width</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">wrapper</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">margin-left</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">margin-right</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">auto</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nd\">:before</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nd\">:after</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">content</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">display</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">table</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nd\">:after</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">clear</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">both</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">/* Column */</span>\n<span class=\"k\">@mixin</span><span class=\"nf\"> col</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$width</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">$padding</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">float</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">left</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">width</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"nt\">percentage</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">width</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">@if</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$padding</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">padding-left</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">gutter</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">padding-right</span><span class=\"nd\">:</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span><span class=\"nt\">gutter</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nt\">2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>BOOM!

I tried to use many different applications but I ended up with <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/3\">Sublime Text</a> and I love it. I always look for some useful tricks and tips that saves myself from tedious tasks. One of this things is definitely core feature of Sublime Text - snippets. Let me show you how I use it and how does it speed my workflow up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"gists-vs-sublime-snippets\">Gists vs Sublime Snippets <a href=\"#gists-vs-sublime-snippets\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is so many web services and applications to save code bits. This feature is build in most of the code editors as well. I tested some of them and the only two methods that I can recommend are <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html\">native snippets</a> build into Sublime Text and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">Gist by Github</a>. Rest of them are not working well for me. Opening a different application or new browser window in the middle of script isn&rsquo;t something that we need. Snippets should be easily accessible and quick to implement.</p>\n<p>The biggest advantage of GitHub snippets is awesome community, power of version control and ability to exchange comments about your collection. To manage your gists collection I highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.gistboxapp.com/\">Gistbox</a> by Rui Yang. To use it with Sublime Text without leaving editor window just install a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/condemil/Gist\">Gist</a>. Constant access to one snippets collection from many computers is another cool thing about it.</p>\n<p>Despite all this cool things that Gist brings on the table I choose to use <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html\">native snippets</a> feature. If you have never worked with Sublime Text Snippets before, I recommend to read this easy to follow <a href=\"http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/sublime-code-snippets/\">article on Hongkiat blog</a>. Simple XML files with .sublime-snippet extension live in ‚ÄòPackages‚Äô folder. Clever idea is to create a separated directory inside ‚ÄòUser‚Äô folder for our reusable bits of code. Dropbox can help us to sync all snippets and settings across many devices. Very detailed instruction how to set syncing up is available on <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing\">Package Control website</a>. Let‚Äôs have a look at some random snippet from my collection:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-xml\" data-lang=\"xml\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;snippet&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;content&gt;</span><span class=\"cp\">&lt;![CDATA[\n</span><span class=\"cp\">  http://lorempixel.com/${1:600}/${2:400}/abstract/\n</span><span class=\"cp\">  ]]&gt;</span><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/content&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;tabTrigger&gt;</span>lorempixel<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/tabTrigger&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;description&gt;</span>other - lorem pixel<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/description&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/snippet&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>The idea is to create reusable element of a code between <code>&lt;![CDATA[</code> and <code>]]&gt;</code>. Placeholders inside a snippets is the reason why I like it so much. After choosing a snippet we can easily navigate via Tab key through predefined placeholders. We can assign to them default values. On example above you can see two placeholders <code>${1:600}</code> and <code>${2:400}</code>. If you would like to get a literal $ (for example inside some jQuery snippet), you have to escape it like this: <code>\\$</code>. <code>tabTrigger</code> and <code>description</code> makes your snippet accessible via keyboard shortcut or select option inside Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P). I don&rsquo;t use <code>scope</code> at all because I want to have an access to my entire library regardless of file type that I&rsquo;m working with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-keep-it-organized\">How I keep it organized? <a href=\"#how-i-keep-it-organized\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After a while of saving all useful lines of codes you can easily end up with hundreds of snippets. Thats why it‚Äôs important to have any strategy to categorise these files. I do it via description tag. Let‚Äôs have a look at this bit of code.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-xml\" data-lang=\"xml\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;description&gt;</span>php - wp - acf - flexible content<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/description&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>This line of code tells me that this is a php code, wordpress specific. ACF stands for <a href=\"http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> - one of my favourite Wordpress plugins. Keeping that simple naming convention helps me to filter my snippets so much! For example that&rsquo;s how looks like snippets structure for all my javaScript files.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-xml\" data-lang=\"xml\">js\n- js - jquery\n- - js - jquery - ajax\n- js - ga\n- js - modernizr\n</code></pre></div><p>Please let me know in a comments how do you approach this subject and what tools do you use to manage your snippets.</p>"},{"title":"How to stay informed in web development game","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/how-to-stay-informed-in-web-development-game/","pubDate":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/how-to-stay-informed-in-web-development-game/","description":"<p>To stay on top of the web development and web design game you need to follow.

In the company that I work for we build cool looking websites for clients that are not necessarily very familiar with technology behind it. It is fantastic tool, with easy to grasp backend and almost endless possibilities. Wordpress was a first thing that came to my mind when I decided to build my own blog. After a quick research I found out that it is many tools that better suits my simple text based blog than Wordpress. Node.js based <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>, very popular <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> or Twitter‚Äôs founders <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a>. Shortly we can expect a new kid on the block - <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/117604881\">typed.com</a>. All this tools are amazing but I wanted something even simpler and then I found a power of static sites generators.</p>\n<p>Idea of static site generators isn‚Äôt any new. As we can see <a href=\"https://staticsitegenerators.net/\">on this website</a> selection of static site generators isn‚Äôt small neither (today is 389 of them). One of the most popular one is <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> created by Github‚Äôs authors. It‚Äôs a first choice of many of my favourite bloggers so I decided to give it a try.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-jekyll\">Why Jekyll? <a href=\"#why-jekyll\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Less stuff to care about, more time to do productive stuff. It doesn‚Äôt require database at all because all files are static. It doesn‚Äôt require advanced server with specific configuration because all files are .html documents. <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> lets you host your website directly from Github repository totally for free! Another good reason to use Github to store your files is constant version controlling (no more manual backups).</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started <a href=\"#getting-started\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It‚Äôs no point to describe how to create your Jekyll blog because you can find fantastic documentation on <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">official website</a>. It takes literally 3 minutes and everything that you need is Ruby and Node.js installed on your Linux or Mac computer. Windows isn‚Äôt officially supported platform however with few little tweaks you can run Jekyll on this platform as well (more information <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/\">here</a>). At this point let me quote Bryan Jones who answered a question on <a href=\"https://codekitapp.com/help/faq/\">CodeKit FAQ</a> page ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on Windows. What do you recommend I use to work with Less, Sass, etc?‚Äù:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"hosting-jekyll-on-github-pages\">Hosting Jekyll on Github Pages <a href=\"#hosting-jekyll-on-github-pages\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> to host your Jekyll website is fantastic idea. You can use it to host your personal or project website. Process of creating one is dead easy but you need to decide first what kind of website is that going to be. Procedure of creating a personal and project website is slightly different. To learn more about differences go to <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">official website</a> where you can find illustrated tutorial. I will go through process of creating personal website.</p>\n<p>The only thing that you need to do is create a Github repository for your project. One requirement here is to use specific pattern to name your repo - githubusername.github.io. My Github username is pawelgrzybek so name of my repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/jekyll-pawelgrzybek\">pawelgrzybek.github.io</a>. Then push your Jekyll project to this repository. Make sure you have ‚Äú_site‚Äù inside your .gitignore file. Thats the trick - you use repository for your source files and output is automatically generated in the background. After pushing your changes it takes literally few seconds to see your website live under <a href=\"http://githubusername.github.io\">http://githubusername.github.io</a>. Yeah, easy like that :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-custom-domain-for-your-jekyll-website\">Using custom domain for your Jekyll website <a href=\"#using-custom-domain-for-your-jekyll-website\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is another very easy process. Add to your repository CNAME file (without any extension) and inside just put your desirable domain. For example, use mydomain.com (without protocol). Don‚Äôt forgot to push your new file to your repo.</p>\n<p>Next step is to do changes on your domain name settings. Log in to your domain‚Äôs provider website and inside DNS settings you need to add two A records.</p>\n<pre><code>192.30.252.153\n192.30.252.154\n</code></pre><p>On Github Pages documentation you can find this <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/#configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider\">process described more in depth</a> but let me show you a better option‚Ä¶</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloudflare-with-jekyll-blog-hosted-on-github-pages\">CloudFlare with Jekyll blog hosted on Github Pages <a href=\"#cloudflare-with-jekyll-blog-hosted-on-github-pages\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>First thing first let me introduce you what <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com\">CloudFlare</a> is. This is an information that you can find on their website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We automatically optimize the delivery of your web pages so your visitors get the fastest page load times and best performance. The result: CloudFlare-powered websites see a significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They didn‚Äôt lie. Don‚Äôt be scared of terms like ‚ÄúCompare plans‚Äù or ‚ÄúPricing‚Äù on their website, because all we need is Free account. Create one now!</p>\n<p>Time to add our website to our account. Go to Websites page and type your domain name (this one that you placed inside your CNAME file) and hit big green button ‚ÄúAdd website‚Äù. After initial scan click big button ‚ÄúContinue setup‚Äù. Now the tricky bit! Add two CNAME records. Name of first one is your domain name (the same as in CNAME file in your Github repository). Name of a second one is ‚Äúwww‚Äù (this one redirects <a href=\"http://www.mydomain.com\">www.mydomain.com</a> to mydomain.com). Alias for both is: githubusername.github.io (in my case githubusername.github.io). Have a look on screen shoot of my DNS settings.</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-04-06-1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"CloudFlare Settings\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"164\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>But hola, wait a second! Why the hell did we set two CNAME records if we can clearly see on Github Pages documentation we should create two A records? Since March 31 2014 CloudFlare is using something called CNAME Flattening. Basically it presents a CNAME as an A record. You can read more about this feature in on <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-CNAME-Flattening-RFC-compliant-support-for-CNAME-at-the-root\">CloudFlare support page</a>. On this stage feel free to add more records if you need to. For example MX records to use email accounts with your custom domain. If all records are in the place click green button ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done entering my DNS records‚Äù.</p>\n<p>On next screen just choose a Free plan, leave rest of the setting as they are and go to a next step. Time to change name servers on your domain‚Äôs provider website. This process may vary dependable of your provider. Read the FAQ section or contact the support if you struggle to do that. That how it looks like on backend of my domain‚Äôs provider:</p>\n<p>\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://pawelgrzybek.com/photos/2015-04-06-2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Domain&amp;rsquo;s DNS settings\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"317\"\n/>\n</p>\n<p>Once updated, return to this CloudFlare and go to next step. This process can take up to 24 hours but normally it‚Äôs ready to go after less than 5 minutes. Be patient.</p>\n<p>BOOM! At this point when you go to your domain you should see your Jekyll project live! But don‚Äôt close the CloudFlare tab yet cause we need to adjust some settings. Go to Websites -&gt; mydomian.com -&gt; CloudFlare settings. Navigate to Performance Settings and change Caching level to Aggressive, Minimum expire TTL to 1month and tick js, css and html under Auto Minify settings. You can adjust tons of more advanced settings here but this is good enough to just start blogging and enjoying well optimised website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helpful-resources\">Helpful resources <a href=\"#helpful-resources\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I did struggle with few minor things during building my website but google.com helped me a lot to solve all issues. The main website that helped me a lot is <a href=\"http://davidensinger.com/\">David Ensinger‚Äôs blog</a>. I really recommend to follow David‚Äôs blog or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidEnsinger\">himself on twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs it guys. I‚Äôm really glad I learned how to use Jekyll and I‚Äôm more than sure I will use this tool on many projects. Feel free to check the source code of my blog on <a href=\"https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/jekyll-pawelgrzybek\">Github repository</a>. That can be amazing alternative to globally overused Wordpress when you create a blog, portfolio or simple static website.

Without it my internet life doesn‚Äôt exist. I care about security. I don‚Äôt use passwords like ‚Äúqwerty123‚Äù or ‚Äúpawel456‚Äù. Every single password that I use across the internet is different, it‚Äôs minimum 15 characters long and means absolutely nothing. It is just a combination of random glyphs that normal human being is not able to remmember. Of course I don‚Äôt remember it neither, I do not write it down or keep in text file on my dropbox. <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a> is my security manager. The only thing that I need to remember is one master password to have an access to all my encrypted and synced via iCloud passwords - easy like that. Combined with iOS version and browsers extensions this app is my number one all the time!</p>\n<h3 id=\"iterm-2\">iTerm 2 <a href=\"#iterm-2\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Command Line heavy user. I don‚Äôt mind Terminal that Mac OS X comes with, but <a href=\"http://iterm2.com/\">iTerm2</a> is much more powerful. It gives you an access to use lots of features that don‚Äôt exist in default Terminal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sublime-text\">Sublime Text <a href=\"#sublime-text\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>My journey through code editors was long and difficult but I‚Äôm finally there. <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/3\">Sublime Text</a> is my code editor of choice. Because it is my main tool that I use to pay my bills I did master it. It comes as a plain text editor but power of this app is in settings and available plugins. I would like to share with you my personal settings that I use and list of my plugins.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;bold_folder_labels&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;caret_extra_width&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;caret_style&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;phase&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;color_scheme&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;Packages/User/SublimeLinter/base16-ocean.dark (SL).tmTheme&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;detect_indentation&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;draw_minimap_border&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;folder_exclude_patterns&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;.sass-cache&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;.git&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;node_modules&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;font_face&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;Source Code Pro&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;font_options&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;no_round&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;font_size&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">16</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;highlight_line&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;highlight_modified_tabs&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;ignored_packages&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;Vintage&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;indent_guide_options&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;draw_normal&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s2\">&#34;draw_active&#34;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;line_padding_bottom&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;line_padding_top&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;rulers&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"mi\">80</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;tab_size&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;theme&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">&#34;Spacegray.sublime-theme&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;translate_tabs_to_spaces&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;trim_trailing_white_space_on_save&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&#34;word_wrap&#34;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><h4 id=\"package-control\">Package Control <a href=\"#package-control\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Name is self descriptive. It lets you install, uninstall or update your extensions in very user friendly way. More about it on <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io/\">official website</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"autofilename\">AutoFileName <a href=\"#autofilename\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Whenever you need to pass a path to file you need to type it manually. With this plugin you have a hints that can speed this process up a bit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"brackethighlighter\">BracketHighlighter <a href=\"#brackethighlighter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>It shows the boundaries of block of code that you currently working on. So helpful especially when you are working on a chunky bit of code that doesn‚Äôt fit on one screen.</p>\n<h4 id=\"color-highlighter\">Color Highlighter <a href=\"#color-highlighter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Whenever you use a colour value in your CSS stylesheet this plugin underlines it with border in appropriate colour. So small but helpful. It is working fine with SASS by taking colors values from variables.</p>\n<h4 id=\"emmet\">Emmet <a href=\"#emmet\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>This is probably one of my favourite plugins of all the time. Creating a HTML markup with this tool takes a seconds. It comes very handy in CSS as well (tons of intuitive shortcuts). Have a look on <a href=\"http://emmet.io/\">official documentation</a>. It is available for majority of popular code editors. You can use power of Emmet in some web tools like Codepen.io or Sassmeister.</p>\n<h4 id=\"gitgutter\">GitGutter <a href=\"#gitgutter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>If you use Git Version Control this small plugin show you in the sidebar differences between current version and last commit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"scss\">SCSS <a href=\"#scss\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Sublime Text doesn‚Äôt understand SCSS syntax. This plugin adds a syntax highlighting for your SCSS files. It doesn&rsquo;t work excellent (especially with some new features in CSS) but it does the job. If you use something better than this, please let me know in comments.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sftp\">SFTP <a href=\"#sftp\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>I don‚Äôt work directly on FTP that much anymore, but sometimes it happens. Applications like Adobe Dreamweaver or Panic Coda have a FTP client build into app core. This plugin is essentially FTP client for Sublime Text. It lets you work directly on live server or map your local directory with remote server and sync the changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sidebarenhancements\">SideBarEnhancements <a href=\"#sidebarenhancements\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>When you right click on a file in sidebar you don‚Äôt have to many options. With this plugin after right click you can see much more options like ‚ÄúCopy name‚Äù, ‚ÄúCopy path‚Äù or the most frequently used by myself ‚ÄúDuplicate‚Äù.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sublimelinter\">SublimeLinter <a href=\"#sublimelinter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>This is a core plugin for a whole family of different sub plugins. By itself it does‚Äôt do a lot, it is just a necessary bit that you need to install before using plugins like: SublimeLinter-jshint or SublimeLinter-php. This two are my linters of choice. Basically it is a code debugger. It debugs your code by indicating all errors in sidebar. When you hover over faulty line, it show you an error fault and gives you a hint how to fix it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"theme---spacegray\">Theme - Spacegray <a href=\"#theme---spacegray\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Something what is pretty cool in Sublime Text is fact that you can make it look exactly like you want. It‚Äôs very easy to create your own theme, but if you don‚Äôt feel it, you can use one of many amazing themes available on Package Control repository. <a href=\"http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/\">Spacegray</a> is my number one!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mail-app\">Mail App <a href=\"#mail-app\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not that massive mail user. I receive mails mainly from Ebay, Amazon or Discogs :) Default Mail app is more than enough for me. I like how cool is working with iCloud account. I use additionally Gmail account but I manage it through the browser.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reeder\">Reeder <a href=\"#reeder\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a little bit old school. I love RSS and I can‚Äôt imagine how internet could exist without it. I follow about 400 blogs and services across the web. <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/mac/\">This beautiful application</a> is the place where all this stuff are combined and served in beautiful, readable form. I‚Äôm a heavy user of both: OS X and iOS version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanmymac-2\">CleanMyMac 2 <a href=\"#cleanmymac-2\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Your browser saves some cache files, your system generates some reports, many apps create tons of temporary files and all this crap exist somewhere in your Mac. After a while the amount of this files is much bigger than you can imagine. As you can guess CleanMyMac2 cleans your Mac :-) It looks for all the files that your OS can live without and delete them. Additionally you can remove some languages that are not applicable to you or schedule a reminder about next clean. One more thing. This application is one of the best designed app that I have ever seen. Amazing illustrations and smooth animations are really impressive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"copyless\">CopyLess <a href=\"#copyless\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Multiple clipboard. I can&rsquo;t imagine work without it now. You just need to hit a global shortcut on your keyboard and pick from the list item that you would like to paste. Awesome tool!</p>\n<h3 id=\"divvy\">Divvy <a href=\"#divvy\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I use it on both: 27 inch display connect to Mac Mini and 13 inch MacBook Pro. It helps to manage space on your desktop by positioning windows. Have a look on the <a href=\"http://mizage.com/divvy/\">presentation video</a> on official website. Really helpful utility in daily routine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"things\">Things <a href=\"#things\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is my favourite GTD app (get things done). Every single thing that comes to my mind and should be done anytime soon goes to this application. In combination with iOS version it helps me to do things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mamp\">MAMP <a href=\"#mamp\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not a backend developer but I work a lot with Wordpress. I prefer to work locally so to run PHP server locally I use this app. I do not lunch this app very often but definitely it is necessary part of my setup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sketch-3\">Sketch 3 <a href=\"#sketch-3\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I use to be a massive Photoshop lover. I have never wondered that I could replace Photoshop by something else. Nowadays I design every single project in <a href=\"http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/\">Sketch by Bohemian Coding</a>. When you work with this tool you know that this application has been made by developers and designers for developers and designers. It is not a best choice to do any photo retouch or image manipulation. This software is purely to create graphic interfaces of apps and websites. In the company where I work we still use Photoshop, and every single time when I need to do some work I struggle so much. Just give it a try and I promise you you will never come back to PS. It is way more faster, includes tons of features that you couldn‚Äôt find in Adobe‚Äôs app and it is way cheaper!</p>\n<h3 id=\"ia-writter\">iA Writter <a href=\"#ia-writter\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Every single longer form of text that I do I create in this app. Support for Markdown, sync by iCloud and minimal design is all I need. Occasionally I use iOS version to do some quick amendments. Mobile version of this software is awesome as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"google-chrome-and-safari\">Google Chrome and Safari <a href=\"#google-chrome-and-safari\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>On daily basis I‚Äôm a Chrome user. I don‚Äôt mind Safari, it is very reliable app but in terms of debugging websites, Google product is definitely a my winner. The only extensions that I use are: 1Password, AddBlock Plus, Instapaper and Pinboard Tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"web-services\">Web services <a href=\"#web-services\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"dropbox-and-copy\">Dropbox and Copy <a href=\"#dropbox-and-copy\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Both of this services I really like and both of them have own advantages and disadvantages. Dropbox is very popular and it‚Äôs incredibly fast compared to different services. The storage space isn‚Äôt enough unfortunately. Copy is incredibly cool. I have 200GB storage space on my account totally for free. Compared to Dropbox the sync speed isn‚Äôt that fantastic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pinboard\">Pinboard <a href=\"#pinboard\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Bookmarks in browser are so old school. Nowadays we have very nice looking services that saves our links and let us use additional features like tags or categories. My choice is Pinboard. It doesn‚Äôt look that great like for example Pocket but it‚Äôs very fast! Vary fast! This service isn‚Äôt free but it doesn‚Äôt cost much. I highly recommend to check it if you store endless lists of links in your browser bookmarks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feedly\">Feedly <a href=\"#feedly\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>My main source of news from web development community. I follow about many blogs and services and all RSS feeds are combined together here - on my Feedly account. This service is well supported by Reeder App (described above).</p>\n<h3 id=\"instapaper\">Instapaper <a href=\"#instapaper\" class=\"post__hash\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I love the minimalism of this app and build in distract free module. Browser extension and iOS app are awesome. Fantastic tool to read longer texts.</p>"},{"title":"Hello there!","link":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/hello-there/","pubDate":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000","guid":"https://pawelgrzybek.com/hello-there/","description":"<p>I‚Äôm so happy to introduce you my new website.
